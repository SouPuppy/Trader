AAPL, +0.50% climbed 0.7% into record territory Thursday, giving them a bit of a cushion to preserve their longest monthly win streak in nine years. The current record closing price is $195.10 on July 19, 2023. The technology behemoth’s stock has now gained 1.0% so far in July, after running up 49.3% amid a six-month win streak through June. That marked the best first-half performance for the stock since it leapt 66.9% during the first half of 2009. If July’s gain holds, it would be the longest monthly win streak since the seven-month stretch that ended August 2014. It would also mark the first time since Apple went public in December 1981 that it started a year with seven-straight monthly gains. The stock’s recent rally comes after Bloomberg reported earlier this week that Apple aimed to keep production of its upcoming iPhone 15 line relatively steady this year despite economic uncertainty, while an analyst said last week that Apple could roll out its new iPhone a bit later than usual. Apple shares have run up 50.7% year to date, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 NDX, +1.19% has advanced 19.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 5.3%.\n\n---\n\n[2023-07-31] 2023-07-31 04:47:00\n标题: What To Expect From Apple's Q3 Results?\n内容: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to publish its Q3 FY’23 results in early August, reporting on another quarter that is likely to see Apple’s key computing products face sluggish demand. We expect earnings to stand at about $1.07 per share, slightly below consensus estimates. On the other hand, we expect revenues to come in about $74 billion, marking a decline of about 11% versus last year and marginally ahead of consensus estimates. So what are some of the trends that are likely to drive Apple’s results for the quarter? See our analysis on Apple Earnings Preview for a closer look at what to expect when Apple publishes earnings. While Q3 is typically a seasonally weak quarter for Apple, we expect sales of products such as the Mac and iPad to also decline year-over-year, as the remote working trend eases and the broader PC and tablet markets cool. For perspective, over Q2 FY’23, Apple’s Mac sales declined by about 31% year-over-year. However, sales of the iPhone could prove a bit more resilient, given the traction that Apple is seeing in markets such as India, Indonesia, and Turkey where installment plans and trade-in programs are helping drive demand. Apple’s digital services business should partly help Apple ride out the lull in its hardware business driven by higher sales at the AppStore and improving the uptake of other subscription services. However, growth rates are likely to remain below the levels seen last year. That said, it is likely that Apple will continue to expand its gross margins for the quarter driven by a higher mix of service sales, more premium products, and also due to some cost savings. While Apple stock could move higher if it beats earnings, we believe that the stock is overvalued at current levels of about $195 per share. Apple currently trades at over 35x forward earnings, which is high relative to historical levels. Moreover, Apple’s earnings are poised to contract this year per consensus estimates, with revenue growth projected to remain slow over the next year as well. We value Apple at about $162 per share, about 17% below the market price. See our analysis of Apple Valuation for more details on what’s driving our price estimate for Apple and how it compares with peers.

The stock has exhibited a bullish trend, rebounding strongly and surging by over 50% this year, demonstrating Apple's robust growth trajectory. Wall Street's ever-present uncertainty adds an element of suspense as the release of Q3 earnings, anticipated to be 1.08 EPS, becomes a key factor in assessing Apple's financial stability and its capacity for further growth. As Apple teeters on the precipice of its record high, the forthcoming days will reveal if the Q3 earnings will provide enough thrust to propel the stock beyond the elusive $200 threshold. Apple Inc's AAPL stock has been hovering close to the $200 mark, building anticipation for a potential breakthrough. While there has been a slight dip in the stock price, it has found stability just above the daily 20 simple moving average, which is acting as a reliable support level. The stock price has rebounded strongly and is moving upwards, displaying a clear bullish trend. This clear continuation pattern indicates positive momentum. In fact, the stock price has surged by more than 50% this year, demonstrating the tech giant's impressive growth. The potential for Apple's stock price to surpass the $200 mark appears promising following its significant growth this year. However, as is the nature of Wall Street, uncertainty lingers. The release of Q3 earnings on Thursday will be a crucial factor in assessing Apple's financial stability and potential for further growth. According to projections, the expected earnings per share (EPS) in Q3 will be 1.08, which shows a slight decline from the 1.20 EPS recorded in the same quarter of the previous year. It's important to mention that the earnings for Q2 2023 were 1.52, which is significantly higher than the anticipated earnings for Q3. Anticipation builds as Apple teeters on the verge of surpassing its record high of $198.23. The question remains: will Q3 earnings be enough to propel the stock price beyond this significant milestone? Will we witness the long-awaited breakthrough of the $200 threshold, or will it take additional time to gather the required momentum? The answers to these questions will become clear in the next few days. If the result is favorable, it's important to be ready for the possibility of new record highs being created. After the closing bell on Friday, July 28, the stock closed at $195.83, trading up by 1.29%.\n\n---\n\n[2023-08-02] 2023-08-01 17:00:08\n标题: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Slips after Pulling AI Apps from Chinese App Store\n内容: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), one of the biggest names in personal and mobile computing around, just brought out a fresh series of events that left the market reeling. Okay, more like a little nonplussed. Apple’s latest moves very slightly unnerved investors, who pulled out in small numbers, leaving Apple down fractionally in Tuesday afternoon’s trading. First, Apple took a proactive stance and pulled several apps from the Chinese App Store variant ahead of China’s upcoming crackdown on generative AI systems. That means apps like ChatGPT—as well as ChatGPT itself—were pulled from the store in advance. The potential bans won’t kick in until August 15, but Apple clearly got out in front of it. The action the Chinese government looks to take isn’t even really a ban, but requires so many caveats—AI apps must not seek to overthrow the government, and must “respect social morality and ethics”, as well as promote “core values of socialism”, among other things—that it’s likely not worth trying to jump through all those hoops for the sake of a handful of apps. This news comes on the heels of much more pleasant news, as Apple also recently showed off its iPhone 15. Several “major changes” are in the offing this time around, as Apple shows off titanium edges—which might be useful in the face of, say, a dropped phone—as well as a whole new charging port. Thanks to EU regulations, the iPhone 15 and the iPhone 15 Plus will work with USB-C chargers. Analysts, meanwhile, are largely undeterred. Apple stock currently merits a Strong Buy rating, supported by 24 Buy ratings and seven Hold. Meanwhile, Apple stock also offers an upside potential of 3.34% thanks to its average price target of $202.19.

The move will allow passengers to enjoy a wide range of entertainment options during their journey, further solidifying Air Canada's commitment to customer satisfaction, reports Benzinga. Competition News: Apple's Q3 Results Awaited Amid High Expectations Apple is set to release its Q3 results, a critical moment as investors question the fundamentals behind the company's $3 trillion valuation. Analysts expect Apple to post strong iPhone revenues for the quarter, driven by demand for the iPhone 14 and growth in the Chinese market. Additionally, Apple's Services business is expected to see a reacceleration, with estimates placing its overall worth between $1.3 trillion and $1.4 trillion. Despite some concerns and contrasting opinions, Apple's performance in China, strong iPhone demand, and the potential growth of its Services business suggest a positive outlook for the company, reports.

Angel Garcia/Bloomberg As F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote, the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposing ideas in mind and retain the ability to function. Investors have had to take that to heart because 2023 has been marked by solid market gains, even as many stocks are falling behind. From trouble in banking to worries of a recession, there is no shortage of factors that could be weighing on the market yet don’t seem to be at first glance. The S&P 500 was up 5.6% so far this year through Wednesday’s close, while the Nasdaq Composite had gained 13.3%. Yet on closer inspection, it is fair to say that those issues are having an impact: The top five stocks in the S&P 500 are responsible for roughly 60% of the index’s returns, and fewer than one-third of the component companies are outperforming the index, meaning the majority are trailing behind it. Part of the reason a few companies, mainly in tech, are doing so well is that investors are scrambling for shelter in companies with strong so-called competitive moats—business models that would be hard for rivals to mimic. That trend isn’t likely to reverse soon, given that economic risks are mounting, Desh Peramunetilleke, global head of microstrategy at Jefferies, said in a research report.“ The demand for moats should only grow as the economy slows, and hence quality at a reasonable price and low volume remain key focus areas.” Given that the market had a strong first quarter, even if only a few stocks accounted for much of the gains, Peramunetilleke expects that the S&P 500 will be relatively rangebound throughout the second quarter. The second half of the year will be marked by worsening economic conditions. That should lead to a situation where sectors sporting defensive characteristics, led by communication services, healthcare, staples, and utilities, outperform. “Broadly, we still favor sectors with earnings resilience amid a potential US recession in the second half of 2023 while avoiding those with earnings most susceptible to an economic slowdown,” he wrote. Investors should therefore look for strong-moat companies while avoiding the temptation to hunt for bargains among the many value stocks that have lagged behind the market this year, Peramunetilleke said. He favors focusing instead on quality at a reasonable price. His picks in this category include Facebook parent Meta Platforms (ticker: META), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Adobe (ADBE), Caterpillar (CAT), and Humana (HUM). Winners with low risk look likely to include Walmart (WMT), Merck (MRK), McDonald’s (MCD), Altria Group (MO), and Realty Income (O). He also thinks companies with exposure to China will continue to thrive as investors seek to benefit from the that nation’s postpandemic economic reopening without the risk that comes with owning Chinese-listed stocks. In that category, he highlighted Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Nike (NKE), Estée Lauder (EL), and Las Vegas Sands (LVS). Investors could just stick with the S&P 500 this year without trying to guess which component companies will be the winners, if they are comfortable not making any more gains this year. Peramunetilleke’s year-end target for the S&P 500 is 4,050, about six points below where the index ended Wednesday. In the end, buying quality stocks with defensible moats is one sensible tactic for a market that’ has defied many industry watchers’ expectations.

The Cupertino-based company is rarely the first to bring a product to market, but with the help of top-paid talent, Apple just does it better than everyone else. Setting The Stage: It all started with Steve Jobs. The Apple co-founder didn't just unveil new products, he would sell the world on Apple's version before anyone even knew what he was offering. Jobs could shape a product presentation into a story that kept audiences anxiously awaiting the next chapter. He would meticulously craft the unveiling, the same way Apple carefully crafts its products. Apple carries that on today. The company doesn't need to have its hand in every cookie jar, instead, it focuses on being the best in the areas it decides to touch, and it hires some of the best talent to help make its vision a reality. Check This Out: Steve Jobs Was The Master Of Unveiling Apple Products: This Was His Secret For Leaving Audiences Awestruck Taking A Bite Out Of The Apple: Apple doesn't make salary information public, but the tech giant is required to disclose offers in work-visa applications submitted to the U.S. Office of Foreign Labor Certification, per a Business Insider report. The highest base salary in the pay data was $322,000, offered to two of the company's software development engineer managers. The lowest offer Apple made was just over $102,000 to a business systems analyst. For comparison, Google offered talent salaries as low as $55,000 and Microsoft made offers as low as $77,000.

Cupertino, California-based Apple (AAPL) had 145 drivers for its program as of April 28, down from 201 in March, according to MacReports, citing California DMV data. The company's fleet of cars, however, only fell by one, to 66, the news outlet added. Apple (AAPL) did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Seeking Alpha. In 2017, Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook confirmed the existence of the tech giant's interest in autonomous vehicles, calling it \"the mother of all AI projects.\" Earlier this year, Cook said artificial intelligence 'is a major focus\" of the company, adding that the company sees \"enormous potential\" for AI to impact \"virtually everything we do.\" To date, however, Apple (AAPL) has not publicly said it is building an autonomous car, though many media outlets, including Seeking Alpha, have reported on the existence of the tech giant's initiatives, under an initiative known as Project Titan. Last year, Morgan Stanley analysts pondered whether Apple (AAPL) could compete with Tesla (TSLA) in the space, given the vast head-start the Elon Musk-led company has over Apple. At the time, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said Apple (AAPL) entering the electric vehicle market would be the \"ultimate bear case\" for a number of companies, including GM (GM), Fisker (FSR), Ferrari (RACE) and others. No time frame has been given for such an announcement, though Citi analyst Jim Suva said in December that a 2025 launch of the company's move into the market, depending upon the route it takes, could boost the company's overall sales between 2% and 15%.

The stock was trading slightly lower heading into the event. When the tech giant printed its first-quarter results on Feb. 2, the stock was volatile the following day but ended the session up 2.44%. For that quarter, Apple reported an EPS of $1.88 on revenue of $117.154 billion. The company came in under the EPS estimate of $1.94 on revenues of $121.1 billion. For the second quarter, analysts estimate that Apple will print earnings per share of $1.43 on revenues of $92.96 billion. Ahead of the event, Rosenblatt analyst Barton Crockett reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and maintained a $173 price target. Read what the most accurate analysts are saying here... From a technical analysis perspective, Apple’s stock looked bullish heading into the event, having formed the next possible higher low within an uptrend pattern on Thursday. It should be noted that holding stocks or options over an earnings print is akin to gambling because stocks can react bullishly to an earnings miss and bearishly to an earnings beat. Options traders, particularly those who are holding close-dated calls or puts, take on the extra risk because the institutions writing the options increase premiums to account for implied volatility.

The Apple Chart: Apple has been trading in a consistent uptrend since March 2, making a series of higher highs and higher lows. Apple’s most recent higher high was formed on Wednesday at $170.92 and the most recent confirmed higher low was printed at the $162.80 mark on April 26. On Thursday, Apple gapped down, but bulls came in to buy the dip. If Apple receives a bullish reaction to its earnings print, Thursday’s low-of-day may serve as the next higher low within the pattern, making the uptrend likely to continue. If Apple suffers a bearish reaction to the news and falls under $162, the uptrend will be negated and a downtrend may be on the horizon. If that happens, the stock may find support, at least temporarily, at the 50-day simple moving average. Apple has resistance above at $167.88 and $171.03 and support below at $162.14 and $158.09.

        "content": "An attendee wears a Meta Platforms virtual reality headset at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February. Angel Garcia/Bloomberg As F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote, the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposing ideas in mind and retain the ability to function. Investors have had to take that to heart because 2023 has been marked by solid market gains, even as many stocks are falling behind. From trouble in banking to worries of a recession, there is no shortage of factors that could be weighing on the market yet don’t seem to be at first glance. The S&P 500 was up 5.6% so far this year through Wednesday’s close, while the Nasdaq Composite had gained 13.3%. Yet on closer inspection, it is fair to say that those issues are having an impact: The top five stocks in the S&P 500 are responsible for roughly 60% of the index’s returns, and fewer than one-third of the component companies are outperforming the index, meaning the majority are trailing behind it. Part of the reason a few companies, mainly in tech, are doing so well is that investors are scrambling for shelter in companies with strong so-called competitive moats—business models that would be hard for rivals to mimic. That trend isn’t likely to reverse soon, given that economic risks are mounting, Desh Peramunetilleke, global head of microstrategy at Jefferies, said in a research report.“ The demand for moats should only grow as the economy slows, and hence quality at a reasonable price and low volume remain key focus areas.” Given that the market had a strong first quarter, even if only a few stocks accounted for much of the gains, Peramunetilleke expects that the S&P 500 will be relatively rangebound throughout the second quarter. The second half of the year will be marked by worsening economic conditions. That should lead to a situation where sectors sporting defensive characteristics, led by communication services, healthcare, staples, and utilities, outperform. “Broadly, we still favor sectors with earnings resilience amid a potential US recession in the second half of 2023 while avoiding those with earnings most susceptible to an economic slowdown,” he wrote. Investors should therefore look for strong-moat companies while avoiding the temptation to hunt for bargains among the many value stocks that have lagged behind the market this year, Peramunetilleke said. He favors focusing instead on quality at a reasonable price. His picks in this category include Facebook parent Meta Platforms (ticker: META), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Adobe (ADBE), Caterpillar (CAT), and Humana (HUM). Winners with low risk look likely to include Walmart (WMT), Merck (MRK), McDonald’s (MCD), Altria Group (MO), and Realty Income (O). He also thinks companies with exposure to China will continue to thrive as investors seek to benefit from the that nation’s postpandemic economic reopening without the risk that comes with owning Chinese-listed stocks. In that category, he highlighted Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Nike (NKE), Estée Lauder (EL), and Las Vegas Sands (LVS). Investors could just stick with the S&P 500 this year without trying to guess which component companies will be the winners, if they are comfortable not making any more gains this year. Peramunetilleke’s year-end target for the S&P 500 is 4,050, about six points below where the index ended Wednesday. In the end, buying quality stocks with defensible moats is one sensible tactic for a market that’ has defied many industry watchers’ expectations. Write to Teresa Rivas at"

The Cupertino-based company is rarely the first to bring a product to market, but with the help of top-paid talent, Apple just does it better than everyone else. Setting The Stage: It all started with Steve Jobs. The Apple co-founder didn't just unveil new products, he would sell the world on Apple's version before anyone even knew what he was offering. Jobs could shape a product presentation into a story that kept audiences anxiously awaiting the next chapter. He would meticulously craft the unveiling, the same way Apple carefully crafts its products. Apple carries that on today. The company doesn't need to have its hand in every cookie jar, instead, it focuses on being the best in the areas it decides to touch, and it hires some of the best talent to help make its vision a reality. Check This Out: Steve Jobs Was The Master Of Unveiling Apple Products: This Was His Secret For Leaving Audiences Awestruck Taking A Bite Out Of The Apple: Apple doesn't make salary information public, but the tech giant is required to disclose offers in work-visa applications submitted to the U.S. Office of Foreign Labor Certification, per a Business Insider report.

However, it sits at a loss of 28.95% over the past year. Investors might therefore be wondering where the company will be headed in the future and if the rally in its share is set to continue. Get Amazon.com alerts: Much of that trajectory could come down to how its earnings are received when it publishes its result on Feb 2 next week. Let's look at what the future might have in store for the company. Is Amazon a buy ahead of earnings? Although attempting to time the market is generally unadvisable, the looming recession has been discussed extensively over the past six months, so a lower stock price for Amazon and its peer companies could be on the cards. Some warnings include overvaluation in stocks and commodities, a downward trend in the S&P 500 index, a worse-than-expected rebound of consumer spending in China, and China's real estate prices continuing to fall lower each month. These signs all point towards capitulation in the market being possible to be realized soon. Adding to the pessimism is that executives of Amazon itself may hold a bleak outlook for the future. Plans to let go over 18,000 employees were signed off by Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy this year. However, it's also important to frame these Amazon layoffs correctly. It might not signal that Amazon expects long-term weakness, but rather it could be more of a pivot toward reaching greater efficiency. The stock prices and payrolls of tech companies were severely bloated by COVID-19 stimulus money that would never last long-term. The unexpected turnaround of the virus that came quickly in January last year saw restrictions lift, and the money flowing into these stocks detoured in a different direction. How the layoffs could benefit Amazon Layoffs are needed when business conditions change and the company's experiments don't work as expected. Jassy told Amazon investors that it would lay the groundwork for the company to be more resourceful and instill some vigilance into its operations. This change in tact is a far cry from the splurge in spending seen when liquidity was at an all-time high.

Now the team with almost $600M in exits is planning to list Autonomix on the Nasdaq. And you can invest in Autonomix ahead of their intended Nasdaq listing.* *Disclosure: This is a paid advertisement for Autonomix’s Regulation A+ Offering. Please read the offering circular at invest.autonomix.com Invest in Autonomix today. It's a realistic assessment of where the company is headed towards. Capital.com reported that many of the jobs axed were those in human resources and for its 'experiments' Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh, which did not turn out as expected. If the layoffs did not happen, Amazon might as well light some of its money paying those employees on fire. A large-scale hiring freeze is in place for most of the tech industry, and HR professionals looking over empty desks don't contribute to productivity. The mass layoffs might be one of the largest it has ever seen. But still, we were also in extraordinary and uncertain circumstances with no knowing precisely when the pandemic would reach its peak, and it did so rapidly over the first few weeks of 2022. Another argument is that for investors who can see past the immediate threats in front of them and hold Amazon for a decade or longer, it gives them a more attractive entry for scooping up Amazon shares. For better or worse, the market seems to focus on the here and now at the exclusion of everything else. So let's look at Amazon's potential upside for the future and beyond. Valuation Wall Street seems to have an overwhelming feeling of confidence about Amazon's share, despite it only having a moderate buy rating at the time of writing. 42 analysts who cover it rate it a buy, while it also has 2 hold and 2 sell ratings. One of the biggest things investors could feel confident about is its earnings per share (EPS) is expected to grow from 0.68 per share to $1.58 per share. That's an enormous growth of 132.35%, unheard of for a blue-chip stock in the FAANG acronym. Other positive aspects include that its MarketBeat consensus price target currently sits at $145.41, with analysts predicting that it has a 46.6% potential upside. Like other big names this week, investors will watch Amazon closely for guidance on the rest of the year. This may help to confirm some people's suspicions of the impending recession and its economic impact. Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon.com right now?

Ask This Question First.\n内容: Retail is a tough business in any economic climate. A small number of retailers -- think Costco (NASDAQ: COST) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) -- manage to build up durable competitive advantages over the course of decades. Most retailers aren't so lucky. Right now, many retail stocks look surprisingly cheap based on trailing earnings. Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (NYSE: BBY) goes for around 13 times earnings, department store Macy's (NYSE: M) trades for less than 5 times earnings, and grocery chain Kroger (NYSE: KR) changes hands for roughly 14 times earnings. Those are not particularly optimistic valuation multiples. Valuation has its limits With persistently high inflation and rising interest rates pressuring consumer spending, retailers in general are likely in for a rough and unpredictable 2023. Even the strongest retailers are starting to face headwinds. Walmart (NYSE: WMT), for example, suffered a gross margin decline in the third quarter of 2022 and guided for a drop in adjusted earnings for the full fiscal year. Many retailers will see their margins contract this year as consumers pull back on spending. While Macy's stock may look extremely inexpensive, for example, it's probably not as cheap as it looks. Analysts are expecting a modest decline in earnings for the company in the upcoming fiscal year, but that could turn out to be far too optimistic. It's a similar story with Best Buy. Despite tumbling demand for PCs and smartphones, analysts still expect a small increase in Best Buy's earnings per share in the upcoming fiscal year. Color me skeptical. Deciding whether or not to invest in a retailer based on past earnings is problematic for two reasons. First, because the past is the past, and second, because the past few years have been pretty weird. An unprecedented shutdown of the economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 was followed by a period of booming demand and free-flowing stimulus. None of that was normal, so basing investment decisions on a retailer's results during that time doesn't make a ton of sense. Basing investment decisions on analyst estimates for future earnings is problematic because analysts are often wrong, and sometimes very wrong. Analyst estimates can be useful, but they certainly shouldn't form the foundation of anyone's investing process. The most important question When I consider investing in a retailer, I naturally take into account valuation, earnings, and growth. But the most important question I ask is this: If the retailer disappeared from the face of the Earth tomorrow, would consumers really care? Amazon: Yes, consumers would definitely care. There are plenty of e-commerce alternatives, but none of them have anywhere close to the product selection of Amazon. People order from Amazon because it's easy, and no other retailer has replicated that. Costco: Yes. While whether shopping at Costco actually saves you money depends on how prone you are to impulse purchases and overspending, consumers certainly believe that the company saves them money. Costco's membership renewal rates are above 90%. Best Buy: I'd say yes, but not nearly as strongly compared Amazon or Costco. Best Buy has transformed itself over the past decade partly by putting a renewed focus on customer service. That's the company's big differentiator, and it's the reason why the retailer holds a somewhat unique place in the U.S. retail market. Macy's: No. There's nothing special about Macy's. There are surely some loyal customers out there, but that's true of every retailer. Macy's finds itself operating in a portion of the department store industry that has little reason to exist. It's not focused on low prices and value like Kohl's or even Target, and it doesn't have the cachet of a higher-end department store like Nordstrom. Kroger: The grocery business has become concentrated among a small number of megachains, so for that reason, consumers would probably care. But in the grocery industry, I like specialized chains like Sprouts that people shop at for reasons other than it being the closest store to their homes. None of this is to say that the best retailers on this list will definitely be great investments, or that the worst retailers on this list will definitely be duds. But if you want the odds to be in your favor, stick with retailers that have some sort of edge, and that customers genuinely like. 10 stocks we like better than Macy's When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Can Amazon Recover Amid Tech Stock Sell-off?",
        "content": "Amazon.com Inc NASDAQ: AMZN has rallied over the past month, gaining 19.48%. However, it sits at a loss of 28.95% over the past year. Investors might therefore be wondering where the company will be headed in the future and if the rally in its share is set to continue. Get Amazon.com alerts: Much of that trajectory could come down to how its earnings are received when it publishes its result on Feb 2 next week. Let's look at what the future might have in store for the company. Is Amazon a buy ahead of earnings? Although attempting to time the market is generally unadvisable, the looming recession has been discussed extensively over the past six months, so a lower stock price for Amazon and its peer companies could be on the cards. Some warnings include overvaluation in stocks and commodities, a downward trend in the S&P 500 index, a worse-than-expected rebound of consumer spending in China, and China's real estate prices continuing to fall lower each month. These signs all point towards capitulation in the market being possible to be realized soon. Adding to the pessimism is that executives of Amazon itself may hold a bleak outlook for the future. Plans to let go over 18,000 employees were signed off by Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy this year. However, it's also important to frame these Amazon layoffs correctly. It might not signal that Amazon expects long-term weakness, but rather it could be more of a pivot toward reaching greater efficiency. The stock prices and payrolls of tech companies were severely bloated by COVID-19 stimulus money that would never last long-term. The unexpected turnaround of the virus that came quickly in January last year saw restrictions lift, and the money flowing into these stocks detoured in a different direction. How the layoffs could benefit Amazon Layoffs are needed when business conditions change and the company's experiments don't work as expected. Jassy told Amazon investors that it would lay the groundwork for the company to be more resourceful and instill some vigilance into its operations. This change in tact is a far cry from the splurge in spending seen when liquidity was at an all-time high. Ad Autonomix [Investor Alert] Potential Breakthrough Medical Tech Investment Opportunity Autonomix has patented technology that can detect and target nerve signals at an accuracy never seen before, a $100B opportunity. Now the team with almost $600M in exits is planning to list Autonomix on the Nasdaq. And you can invest in Autonomix ahead of their intended Nasdaq listing.* *Disclosure: This is a paid advertisement for Autonomix’s Regulation A+ Offering. Please read the offering circular at invest.autonomix.com Invest in Autonomix today. It's a realistic assessment of where the company is headed towards. Capital.com reported that many of the jobs axed were those in human resources and for its 'experiments' Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh, which did not turn out as expected. If the layoffs did not happen, Amazon might as well light some of its money paying those employees on fire. A large-scale hiring freeze is in place for most of the tech industry, and HR professionals looking over empty desks don't contribute to productivity. The mass layoffs might be one of the largest it has ever seen. But still, we were also in extraordinary and uncertain circumstances with no knowing precisely when the pandemic would reach its peak, and it did so rapidly over the first few weeks of 2022. Another argument is that for investors who can see past the immediate threats in front of them and hold Amazon for a decade or longer, it gives them a more attractive entry for scooping up Amazon shares. For better or worse, the market seems to focus on the here and now at the exclusion of everything else. So let's look at Amazon's potential upside for the future and beyond. Valuation Wall Street seems to have an overwhelming feeling of confidence about Amazon's share, despite it only having a moderate buy rating at the time of writing. 42 analysts who cover it rate it a buy, while it also has 2 hold and 2 sell ratings. One of the biggest things investors could feel confident about is its earnings per share (EPS) is expected to grow from 0.68 per share to $1.58 per share. That's an enormous growth of 132.35%, unheard of for a blue-chip stock in the FAANG acronym. Other positive aspects include that its MarketBeat consensus price target currently sits at $145.41, with analysts predicting that it has a 46.6% potential upside. Like other big names this week, investors will watch Amazon closely for guidance on the rest of the year. This may help to confirm some people's suspicions of the impending recession and its economic impact. Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon.com right now?

        "title": "Want to Invest in a Retail Stock? Ask This Question First.",
        "content": "Retail is a tough business in any economic climate. A small number of retailers -- think Costco (NASDAQ: COST) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) -- manage to build up durable competitive advantages over the course of decades. Most retailers aren't so lucky. Right now, many retail stocks look surprisingly cheap based on trailing earnings. Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (NYSE: BBY) goes for around 13 times earnings, department store Macy's (NYSE: M) trades for less than 5 times earnings, and grocery chain Kroger (NYSE: KR) changes hands for roughly 14 times earnings. Those are not particularly optimistic valuation multiples. Valuation has its limits With persistently high inflation and rising interest rates pressuring consumer spending, retailers in general are likely in for a rough and unpredictable 2023. Even the strongest retailers are starting to face headwinds. Walmart (NYSE: WMT), for example, suffered a gross margin decline in the third quarter of 2022 and guided for a drop in adjusted earnings for the full fiscal year. Many retailers will see their margins contract this year as consumers pull back on spending. While Macy's stock may look extremely inexpensive, for example, it's probably not as cheap as it looks. Analysts are expecting a modest decline in earnings for the company in the upcoming fiscal year, but that could turn out to be far too optimistic. It's a similar story with Best Buy. Despite tumbling demand for PCs and smartphones, analysts still expect a small increase in Best Buy's earnings per share in the upcoming fiscal year. Color me skeptical.

L.L. Zamenhof, the Polish ophthalmologist who constructed the language in the late 19th century, had envisioned Esperanto as a simple, beautifully designed language that is easy to learn. It has 16 basic rules and no irregular verbs, and draws its roots from Romance languages, German, Slavic and Greek. Zamenhof had hoped that Esperanto would be adopted worldwide as an international second language and that it would reduce social conflict between communities and nations. It never caught on, but dedicated Esperantists still exist the world over. Eroshenko, who would become one of those devotees, was captivated by how the invented language enabled him to converse with people all over the world. In Japan, he befriended activists, gave lectures in Esperanto and started writing in the language, which he would describe as “the key to all my philosophy.” He believed in its power to connect people, and change people. His body of work includes a set of Esperanto fairy tales — stories about mice and flowers and paper lanterns — that are quaint on the surface but also scathing critiques of Western civilization’s deficiencies. Eroshenko’s work explores colonization, police brutality, human destruction of the natural world, and the marginalization of the poorest and most vulnerable among us. English translations by Adam Kuplowsky of some of these works, along with translations of other fairy tales Eroshenko wrote in Japanese, are available for the first time in a new book called “The Narrow Cage and Other Modern Fairy Tales,” published this year by Columbia University Press. WpGet the full experience.Choose your plan ArrowRight “I heard this quote somewhere that Tolstoy only took two hours to learn Esperanto,” said Kuplowsky, who set out to learn Esperanto expressly so that he could translate Eroshenko’s work. “I thought that maybe it would take me a month.” All the books Obama is reading this summer Kuplowsky was right. He picked up an Esperanto textbook on Project Gutenberg and, with the help of several dictionaries, felt confident enough to translate after a month. In the process, he joined a small but dedicated group of Esperanto translators interested in preserving and disseminating original Esperanto literature. Many of them are drawn to these works because of the ideology that Zamenhof promoted when he introduced the language, including its emphasis on nondiscrimination and broad-mindedness. Passionate Esperantists are interested not just in translation but also in the preservation of Esperanto literature in its original form. There are coordinated efforts to promote the literature, including an initiative called Fenikso that aims to republish a set of Esperanto classics. Spearheaded by Esperanto-USA, the project hopes to republish 37 prose and 22 poetry books. Advertisement “It’s a literary canon if you will,” said Hoss Firooznia, an Esperanto-USA board member who is leading the effort. “These are books which, if you’re learning Esperanto, you’re advised to read, but students can’t find them anymore.” That preservation effort is not without challenges. Copyrights on some of the books have expired. For others, Firooznia tries to secure rights by contacting publishers, authors or the descendants of authors. “The publishing houses are these mom-and-pop organizations that really don’t have much financial backing,” Firooznia said. “Once the publisher disappears and the books are out of print, you can’t find them anymore.” Firooznia’s goal is to republish three or four books by the end of the year. The books will be available digitally and as print-on-demand. Among the first to be republished is “Viktimoj,” by the Hungarian writer Julio Baghy, a novel based on Baghy’s experiences as a prisoner of war in Siberia that was published in serial form in 1925 in the Literatura Mondo magazine. Advertisement Firooznia, who works full-time as a systems administrator at the University of Rochester, also recently completed his MFA in literary translation at the university. His thesis is an English translation of an Esperanto novel called “Ombro sur interna pejzagho,” or “Shadows on an Inner Landscape,” by the Croatian author Spomenka Stimec, a loosely autobiographical title that chronicles the collapse of a woman’s marriage. At the University of Rochester, Firooznia runs an Esperanto club and maintains a small Esperanto lending library in his office. He’s also teaching an online course in literary translation from Esperanto to other languages. Share this articleShare “I’m teaching other Esperantists what I learned,” he said. “We’re talking about translation into and out of and just general questions of translation like balancing fidelity versus fluency.” Advertisement Esperanto is sometimes looked upon with disdain as a novelty language with few readers and speakers. “By now this artificial language has become something of a joke except to those few who study, speak and write it,” a Washington Post critic wrote in a 2001 review of “Masquerade,” a memoir originally written in Esperanto by Tivadar Soros, father of billionaire George Soros. The translator of the text in question was Humphrey Tonkin, widely regarded as one of the most respected Esperantists living today. Tonkin, 83, has taught at the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University. He is a former president of the University of Hartford and has twice been the president of the Universal Esperanto Association, the largest body of Esperantists in the world. Let's talk about our book reading habits “If you’re outside of Esperanto, and you’ve never heard of it before, then by definition it’s minuscule,” Tonkin said. “It’s about not knowing about something and belittling it.” Advertisement Tonkin said those who write in Esperanto tend to be internationalists, people who have a perspective on the world that is not rooted in their own nationality. “You could say that Esperanto literature will assume an attitude of nondiscrimination,” he said. “There’s a kind of openness that you don’t find in other literature to the same extent.” The preservation of Esperanto in both its spoken and written forms facilitates activism, said Giridhar Rao, an Esperantist and professor in the school of education at Azim Premji University. “The Esperanto community is already primed to think about language asymmetry, language inequality, language and power,” Rao said. Rao became interested in Esperanto in the 1990s, when he was researching science fiction as a doctoral student and a colleague pointed him toward Esperanto literature. Advertisement “It’s a kind of large-scale planetary thinking, which Esperanto and science fiction seem to both have,” Rao said. “There’s a sense of the future, of imagining that another world is possible, that another language is possible.” For Kuplowsky, too, the language offers a sense of connection. A second-generation Ukrainian Canadian, he does not know Ukrainian. But it was deeply meaningful to him that he was able to read — and translate — the work of Eroshenko from Esperanto to English, not least of all because the stories resonate surprisingly with Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. “They expose, in the symbolic form of fairy tales, all the insanity, hypocrisy and tragedy of war,” Kuplowsky said. “They remind us how the problems of the past century remain the problems of the present century.” Sindya Bhanoo is a reporter based in Corvallis, Ore.

Doug Herrington, CEO of Worldwide Amazon Stores, said in the 60 largest U.S. metro areas, more than half of Prime member packages arrived on the same day or the next day from when they ordered them. He added so far this year, 1.8 billion units were shipped to U.S. Prime members on the same day or next day, more than four times what was delivered at those speeds before the pandemic in 2019. Amazon has achieved quicker delivery times by dividing the country into smaller, easier-to-reach regions, using machine-learning technology to better predict buying trends, and growing its same-day delivery network, Herrington explained. By making those changes, Amazon also reduced costs, which in turn helped customers save money, he said. Shares of Amazon advanced 1.1% following the news and traded around their 2023 highs.

Amazon Clinic was introduced in November as a virtual health service operating in 32 states, now extended to all 50 states and Washington, D.C. However, its message-based consultations are still limited to 34 states. With Amazon Clinic, users can compare response times and rates of different healthcare providers, complete a questionnaire, and connect with their chosen provider without an appointment or insurance. The clinician provides a treatment plan, which may include a prescription that can be filled at Amazon Pharmacy or any other pharmacy. The ecommerce giant has been attempting to expand into the healthcare sector for the past few years. In 2018, it bought the online pharmacy PillPack for $750 million. In 2020, it launched Amazon Pharmacy as a full-service online pharmacy with savings for Prime members. Amazon Care was launched in 2019 as a pilot program for its headquarters in Seattle but was discontinued in December 2022. Last year, Amazon closed a $3.9 billion deal to acquire primary care provider One Medical, gaining access to over 200 physical medical offices in 26 markets and about 815,000 members.\n\n---\n\n[2023-08-02] 2023-08-02 14:00:00\n标题: A poet’s ground-level account of the collapse of Uyghur society\n内容: Listen 6 min Share Comment on this storyComment Add to your saved storiesSave When mass detentions swept China’s Xinjiang province in 2017, Tahir Hamut Izgil was one of the rising Uyghur writers of his generation. Now safely settled with his family in Washington, he’s one of the few who escaped. WpGet the full experience.Choose your plan ArrowRight It seems fitting, then, that Izgil’s lucid and quietly terrifying memoir, “Waiting to Be Arrested at Night,” while alive with heartbreaking tributes to writer friends now vanished into the camps, repeatedly returns to moments of eerie silence. Names of the disappeared are whispered on the street. Conversations end abruptly, and children vanish from school. Izgil, a groundbreaking poet and filmmaker whose work blends a love of Uyghur traditions with “that murky abstract stuff,” in the words of a Chinese police officer, cuts dangerous lines from his own verse. In a neighborhood police station, a tortured man screams, and a policeman hurries to shut the basement door. Advertisement That stifled cry, which Izgil hears while waiting to complete yet another form, haunts the book. Through its years-long crackdown, China has sent 1 million or more Uyghurs and Turkic minorities to a sprawling network of reeducation centers while subjecting them to sterilization, forced labor and torture. Outside the camps officials have razed mosques and bulldozed cemeteries. How does one surviving poet tell the story of a campaign to erase his entire culture? Izgil is, of course, not the only Uyghur author to tackle the question. Gulbahar Haitiwaji takes us inside the walls in “How I Survived a Chinese ‘Reeducation’ Camp,” while recent memoirs from exiled activists Gulchehra Hoja and Nury Turkel blend personal stories with broader accounts of the long Uyghur struggle. Izgil, who had long published both poems and criticism but released his first collection of poetry just as the roundups began, cuts a different path. He could certainly have written a big-picture view if he chose. As a young scholar, Izgil wrote the first broad Uyghur-language survey of Western modernist literature. He might have also dwelled on the three years he spent in labor camps in the 1990s, but those dark days are barely mentioned here. Instead, the poet keeps his head down, narratively speaking, and blends contemporary stories of family, friends and even the police officers who harass him into a ground-level account of the collapse of Uyghur society. Advertisement The result, translated by Joshua Freeman, is a lived-in page-turner with the slow, grim boil of a Le Carré novel (no shooting, but no hope of justice either, with plenty of code words and offstage violence), threaded with a few of Izgil’s short, striking poems. Together they tell a story immediately accessible to anyone who’s ever found themselves tied up in red tape — and capture, in harrowing miniature, a portrait of horrors we can scarcely imagine. Share this articleShare The story opens in 2009 with a police interrogation, all too routine for many Uyghurs. Izgil clings to normalcy (“In my experience, reacting too strongly was unhelpful in these situations”) but soon is forced to surrender his email and social media passwords. Things unravel from there: Censors order Izgil to erase the greeting “assalamu alaikum” (“Peace be upon you”) from his film scripts; all Uyghurs soon learn to skip the phrase in public. Radios and youth soccer leagues are banned, as are ordinary household objects such as matches. Anything remotely religious is forbidden; Izgil’s neighbors take turns throwing Qurans down a manhole at midnight, while others take out newspaper ads announcing that they’ve changed their own names. China’s Xinjiang faces long road to rehabilitation The newspapers have plenty of room. The crackdown’s official announcements are few, and a near-total information blackout leaves Uyghurs living “like frogs at the bottom of a well.” I learned to dread the words “We had heard…,” which Izgil uses to introduce each new turn of the screw. Some gossip comes coded: To be sent to the camps is to “study,” the wider crackdown is a “storm.” Other whispers are all too exact, as when police summon Izgil and his wife to sign what they understand to be their final papers before the camps: “I had heard about this form.” Driving home through Urumqi one evening in June 2017, Izgil spots truckloads of armed military police raiding a Uyghur neighborhood, accompanied by neighborhood committee officials with “blue clipboards in their hands.” The terror has become real. Personal experience and rumor have their narrative limits; those seeking a deep dive on, say, Xinjiang’s 2009 Uyghur-Han riots must look elsewhere. But we don’t turn to poets like Izgil for crunchy history. Instead, read “Waiting to Be Arrested at Night” for its many human-scale moments of sorrow and grace. Advertisement As the crackdown rages outside, Izgil takes us inside the smoke-filled Urumqi convenience store where his writer friends gather in the evenings. Business is slow. Almas the shopkeeper translates Bertrand Russell just to keep busy, one arm pinned with the red armband that police require all merchants to wear. Eli the ponytailed bookseller has run out of Uyghur books to sell. The novelist Perhat Tursun is there, wearily chain-smoking, his passport forever revoked. Foreign countries, he grumbles, are like “a woman I was in love with but couldn’t marry.” Izgil, working on his own plans to flee, holds back a final farewell. Anyone who knew would be in even greater danger. After a long-shot bureaucratic prayer releases their confiscated passports, Izgil and his family flee China in August 2017 to seek asylum in Washington, home to one of the United States’ largest Uyghur communities. The Urumqi convenience store is shuttered now; friends report that Almas and Eli have been arrested and sent to “study.” Pain and survivor’s guilt smolder beneath Izgil’s calm and careful prose, bursting into flame in his poems: “These days / are crowded with shattered horizons / shattered!” He now lives trapped in “the runaway season / when surrender hides deep in the suitcase / when noble doubts run over the weight limit.” In 2020, Izgil learns that Tursun has been sentenced to 16 years in prison. Desperate for news, he calls the novelist’s office. The woman who answers listens silently as he pleads for news, then hangs up without a word. Only then, Izgil writes, did he understand he’d truly lost his friend forever: “We will see these dear ones only in our dreams.” Dan Keane is a freelance writer based in New Zealand and a former senior lecturer at NYU Shanghai.

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) reported Monday it made the fastest deliveries ever to its Prime members last quarter. Doug Herrington, CEO of Worldwide Amazon Stores, said in the 60 largest U.S. metro areas, more than half of Prime member packages arrived on the same day or the next day from when they ordered them. He added so far this year, 1.8 billion units were shipped to U.S. Prime members on the same day or next day, more than four times what was delivered at those speeds before the pandemic in 2019. Amazon has achieved quicker delivery times by dividing the country into smaller, easier-to-reach regions, using machine-learning technology to better predict buying trends, and growing its same-day delivery network, Herrington explained. By making those changes, Amazon also reduced costs, which in turn helped customers save money, he said. Shares of Amazon advanced 1.1% following the news and traded around their 2023 highs. YCharts"

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) is expanding its virtual clinic services nationwide to cover over 30 common health conditions such as pink eye and urinary tract infections, the company announced on Monday. Amazon Clinic was introduced in November as a virtual health service operating in 32 states, now extended to all 50 states and Washington, D.C. However, its message-based consultations are still limited to 34 states. With Amazon Clinic, users can compare response times and rates of different healthcare providers, complete a questionnaire, and connect with their chosen provider without an appointment or insurance. The clinician provides a treatment plan, which may include a prescription that can be filled at Amazon Pharmacy or any other pharmacy. The ecommerce giant has been attempting to expand into the healthcare sector for the past few years. In 2018, it bought the online pharmacy PillPack for $750 million. In 2020, it launched Amazon Pharmacy as a full-service online pharmacy with savings for Prime members. Amazon Care was launched in 2019 as a pilot program for its headquarters in Seattle but was discontinued in December 2022. Last year, Amazon closed a $3.9 billion deal to acquire primary care provider One Medical, gaining access to over 200 physical medical offices in 26 markets and about 815,000 members."

        "content": "Listen 6 min Share Comment on this storyComment Add to your saved storiesSave When mass detentions swept China’s Xinjiang province in 2017, Tahir Hamut Izgil was one of the rising Uyghur writers of his generation. Now safely settled with his family in Washington, he’s one of the few who escaped. WpGet the full experience.Choose your plan ArrowRight It seems fitting, then, that Izgil’s lucid and quietly terrifying memoir, “Waiting to Be Arrested at Night,” while alive with heartbreaking tributes to writer friends now vanished into the camps, repeatedly returns to moments of eerie silence. Names of the disappeared are whispered on the street. Conversations end abruptly, and children vanish from school. Izgil, a groundbreaking poet and filmmaker whose work blends a love of Uyghur traditions with “that murky abstract stuff,” in the words of a Chinese police officer, cuts dangerous lines from his own verse. In a neighborhood police station, a tortured man screams, and a policeman hurries to shut the basement door. Advertisement That stifled cry, which Izgil hears while waiting to complete yet another form, haunts the book. Through its years-long crackdown, China has sent 1 million or more Uyghurs and Turkic minorities to a sprawling network of reeducation centers while subjecting them to sterilization, forced labor and torture. Outside the camps officials have razed mosques and bulldozed cemeteries. How does one surviving poet tell the story of a campaign to erase his entire culture? Izgil is, of course, not the only Uyghur author to tackle the question. Gulbahar Haitiwaji takes us inside the walls in “How I Survived a Chinese ‘Reeducation’ Camp,” while recent memoirs from exiled activists Gulchehra Hoja and Nury Turkel blend personal stories with broader accounts of the long Uyghur struggle. Izgil, who had long published both poems and criticism but released his first collection of poetry just as the roundups began, cuts a different path. He could certainly have written a big-picture view if he chose. As a young scholar, Izgil wrote the first broad Uyghur-language survey of Western modernist literature. He might have also dwelled on the three years he spent in labor camps in the 1990s, but those dark days are barely mentioned here. Instead, the poet keeps his head down, narratively speaking, and blends contemporary stories of family, friends and even the police officers who harass him into a ground-level account of the collapse of Uyghur society. Advertisement The result, translated by Joshua Freeman, is a lived-in page-turner with the slow, grim boil of a Le Carré novel (no shooting, but no hope of justice either, with plenty of code words and offstage violence), threaded with a few of Izgil’s short, striking poems. Together they tell a story immediately accessible to anyone who’s ever found themselves tied up in red tape — and capture, in harrowing miniature, a portrait of horrors we can scarcely imagine. Share this articleShare The story opens in 2009 with a police interrogation, all too routine for many Uyghurs. Izgil clings to normalcy (“In my experience, reacting too strongly was unhelpful in these situations”) but soon is forced to surrender his email and social media passwords. Things unravel from there: Censors order Izgil to erase the greeting “assalamu alaikum” (“Peace be upon you”) from his film scripts; all Uyghurs soon learn to skip the phrase in public. Radios and youth soccer leagues are banned, as are ordinary household objects such as matches. Anything remotely religious is forbidden; Izgil’s neighbors take turns throwing Qurans down a manhole at midnight, while others take out newspaper ads announcing that they’ve changed their own names. China’s Xinjiang faces long road to rehabilitation The newspapers have plenty of room. The crackdown’s official announcements are few, and a near-total information blackout leaves Uyghurs living “like frogs at the bottom of a well.” I learned to dread the words “We had heard…,” which Izgil uses to introduce each new turn of the screw. Some gossip comes coded: To be sent to the camps is to “study,” the wider crackdown is a “storm.” Other whispers are all too exact, as when police summon Izgil and his wife to sign what they understand to be their final papers before the camps: “I had heard about this form.” Driving home through Urumqi one evening in June 2017, Izgil spots truckloads of armed military police raiding a Uyghur neighborhood, accompanied by neighborhood committee officials with “blue clipboards in their hands.” The terror has become real. Personal experience and rumor have their narrative limits; those seeking a deep dive on, say, Xinjiang’s 2009 Uyghur-Han riots must look elsewhere. But we don’t turn to poets like Izgil for crunchy history. Instead, read “Waiting to Be Arrested at Night” for its many human-scale moments of sorrow and grace. Advertisement As the crackdown rages outside, Izgil takes us inside the smoke-filled Urumqi convenience store where his writer friends gather in the evenings. Business is slow. Almas the shopkeeper translates Bertrand Russell just to keep busy, one arm pinned with the red armband that police require all merchants to wear. Eli the ponytailed bookseller has run out of Uyghur books to sell. The novelist Perhat Tursun is there, wearily chain-smoking, his passport forever revoked. Foreign countries, he grumbles, are like “a woman I was in love with but couldn’t marry.” Izgil, working on his own plans to flee, holds back a final farewell. Anyone who knew would be in even greater danger. After a long-shot bureaucratic prayer releases their confiscated passports, Izgil and his family flee China in August 2017 to seek asylum in Washington, home to one of the United States’ largest Uyghur communities. The Urumqi convenience store is shuttered now; friends report that Almas and Eli have been arrested and sent to “study.” Pain and survivor’s guilt smolder beneath Izgil’s calm and careful prose, bursting into flame in his poems: “These days / are crowded with shattered horizons / shattered!” He now lives trapped in “the runaway season / when surrender hides deep in the suitcase / when noble doubts run over the weight limit.” In 2020, Izgil learns that Tursun has been sentenced to 16 years in prison. Desperate for news, he calls the novelist’s office. The woman who answers listens silently as he pleads for news, then hangs up without a word. Only then, Izgil writes, did he understand he’d truly lost his friend forever: “We will see these dear ones only in our dreams.” Dan Keane is a freelance writer based in New Zealand and a former senior lecturer at NYU Shanghai.

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN Quick QuoteAMZN - Free Report) reported $134.38 billion in revenue for the quarter ended June 2023, representing a year-over-year increase of 10.9%.

The company delivered an EPS surprise of +85.29%, with the consensus EPS estimate being $0.34.

The e-commerce goliath recently added to its growing pile of debt with an $8 billion loan. Slowing growth, weakening profitability and planned acquisitions, including 1Life Healthcare and iRobot, are reshaping Amazon’s balance sheet and creating new claims on its resources. HJBC By Breakingviews Amazon.com (AMZN) has rounded up some unusual suspects. The e-commerce goliath recently added to its growing pile of debt with an $8 billion loan. The extra funding is curious, but not as much as the foreign banks providing it. Slowing growth, weakening profitability and planned acquisitions, including 1Life Healthcare and iRobot, are reshaping Amazon’s balance sheet and creating new claims on its resources. It had nearly $60 billion in combined cash and easy-to-sell securities as of Sept. 30, but it also burned through some $20 billion of free cash in the 12 months ending in the third quarter. In that context, raising $8 billion, fast on the heels of arranging a $10 billion term loan in November, seems intuitive for boss Andy Jassy. Less intuitive is the roster of financiers. After first tapping the market’s biggest bookrunners, Amazon\n\n---\n\n[2023-01-27] 2023-01-27 00:00:00\n标题: Can Amazon Recover Amid Tech Stock Sell-off?\n内容: Amazon.com Inc NASDAQ: AMZN has rallied over the past month, gaining 19.48%. However, it sits at a loss of 28.95% over the past year. Investors might therefore be wondering where the company will be headed in the future and if the rally in its share is set to continue. Get Amazon.com alerts: Much of that trajectory could come down to how its earnings are received when it publishes its result on Feb 2 next week. Let's look at what the future might have in store for the company. Is Amazon a buy ahead of earnings? Although attempting to time the market is generally unadvisable, the looming recession has been discussed extensively over the past six months, so a lower stock price for Amazon and its peer companies could be on the cards. Some warnings include overvaluation in stocks and commodities, a downward trend in the S&P 500 index, a worse-than-expected rebound of consumer spending in China, and China's real estate prices continuing to fall lower each month. These signs all point towards capitulation in the market being possible to be realized soon. Adding to the pessimism is that executives of Amazon itself may hold a bleak outlook for the future. Plans to let go over 18,000 employees were signed off by Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy this year. However, it's also important to frame these Amazon layoffs correctly. It might not signal that Amazon expects long-term weakness, but rather it could be more of a pivot toward reaching greater efficiency. The stock prices and payrolls of tech companies were severely bloated by COVID-19 stimulus money that would never last long-term. The unexpected turnaround of the virus that came quickly in January last year saw restrictions lift, and the money flowing into these stocks detoured in a different direction. How the layoffs could benefit Amazon Layoffs are needed when business conditions change and the company's experiments don't work as expected. Jassy told Amazon investors that it would lay the groundwork for the company to be more resourceful and instill some vigilance into its operations. This change in tact is a far cry from the splurge in spending seen when liquidity was at an all-time high.

Now the team with almost $600M in exits is planning to list Autonomix on the Nasdaq. And you can invest in Autonomix ahead of their intended Nasdaq listing.* *Disclosure: This is a paid advertisement for Autonomix’s Regulation A+ Offering. Please read the offering circular at invest.autonomix.com Invest in Autonomix today. It's a realistic assessment of where the company is headed towards. Capital.com reported that many of the jobs axed were those in human resources and for its 'experiments' Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh, which did not turn out as expected. If the layoffs did not happen, Amazon might as well light some of its money paying those employees on fire. A large-scale hiring freeze is in place for most of the tech industry, and HR professionals looking over empty desks don't contribute to productivity. The mass layoffs might be one of the largest it has ever seen. But still, we were also in extraordinary and uncertain circumstances with no knowing precisely when the pandemic would reach its peak, and it did so rapidly over the first few weeks of 2022. Another argument is that for investors who can see past the immediate threats in front of them and hold Amazon for a decade or longer, it gives them a more attractive entry for scooping up Amazon shares. For better or worse, the market seems to focus on the here and now at the exclusion of everything else. So let's look at Amazon's potential upside for the future and beyond. Valuation Wall Street seems to have an overwhelming feeling of confidence about Amazon's share, despite it only having a moderate buy rating at the time of writing. 42 analysts who cover it rate it a buy, while it also has 2 hold and 2 sell ratings. One of the biggest things investors could feel confident about is its earnings per share (EPS) is expected to grow from 0.68 per share to $1.58 per share. That's an enormous growth of 132.35%, unheard of for a blue-chip stock in the FAANG acronym. Other positive aspects include that its MarketBeat consensus price target currently sits at $145.41, with analysts predicting that it has a 46.6% potential upside. Like other big names this week, investors will watch Amazon closely for guidance on the rest of the year. This may help to confirm some people's suspicions of the impending recession and its economic impact. Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon.com right now?

Ask This Question First.\n内容: Retail is a tough business in any economic climate. A small number of retailers -- think Costco (NASDAQ: COST) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) -- manage to build up durable competitive advantages over the course of decades. Most retailers aren't so lucky. Right now, many retail stocks look surprisingly cheap based on trailing earnings. Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (NYSE: BBY) goes for around 13 times earnings, department store Macy's (NYSE: M) trades for less than 5 times earnings, and grocery chain Kroger (NYSE: KR) changes hands for roughly 14 times earnings. Those are not particularly optimistic valuation multiples. Valuation has its limits With persistently high inflation and rising interest rates pressuring consumer spending, retailers in general are likely in for a rough and unpredictable 2023. Even the strongest retailers are starting to face headwinds. Walmart (NYSE: WMT), for example, suffered a gross margin decline in the third quarter of 2022 and guided for a drop in adjusted earnings for the full fiscal year. Many retailers will see their margins contract this year as consumers pull back on spending. While Macy's stock may look extremely inexpensive, for example, it's probably not as cheap as it looks. Analysts are expecting a modest decline in earnings for the company in the upcoming fiscal year, but that could turn out to be far too optimistic. It's a similar story with Best Buy. Despite tumbling demand for PCs and smartphones, analysts still expect a small increase in Best Buy's earnings per share in the upcoming fiscal year. Color me skeptical. Deciding whether or not to invest in a retailer based on past earnings is problematic for two reasons. First, because the past is the past, and second, because the past few years have been pretty weird. An unprecedented shutdown of the economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 was followed by a period of booming demand and free-flowing stimulus. None of that was normal, so basing investment decisions on a retailer's results during that time doesn't make a ton of sense. Basing investment decisions on analyst estimates for future earnings is problematic because analysts are often wrong, and sometimes very wrong. Analyst estimates can be useful, but they certainly shouldn't form the foundation of anyone's investing process. The most important question When I consider investing in a retailer, I naturally take into account valuation, earnings, and growth. But the most important question I ask is this: If the retailer disappeared from the face of the Earth tomorrow, would consumers really care? Amazon: Yes, consumers would definitely care. There are plenty of e-commerce alternatives, but none of them have anywhere close to the product selection of Amazon. People order from Amazon because it's easy, and no other retailer has replicated that. Costco: Yes. While whether shopping at Costco actually saves you money depends on how prone you are to impulse purchases and overspending, consumers certainly believe that the company saves them money. Costco's membership renewal rates are above 90%. Best Buy: I'd say yes, but not nearly as strongly compared Amazon or Costco. Best Buy has transformed itself over the past decade partly by putting a renewed focus on customer service. That's the company's big differentiator, and it's the reason why the retailer holds a somewhat unique place in the U.S. retail market. Macy's: No. There's nothing special about Macy's. There are surely some loyal customers out there, but that's true of every retailer. Macy's finds itself operating in a portion of the department store industry that has little reason to exist. It's not focused on low prices and value like Kohl's or even Target, and it doesn't have the cachet of a higher-end department store like Nordstrom. Kroger: The grocery business has become concentrated among a small number of megachains, so for that reason, consumers would probably care. But in the grocery industry, I like specialized chains like Sprouts that people shop at for reasons other than it being the closest store to their homes. None of this is to say that the best retailers on this list will definitely be great investments, or that the worst retailers on this list will definitely be duds. But if you want the odds to be in your favor, stick with retailers that have some sort of edge, and that customers genuinely like. 10 stocks we like better than Macy's When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

I discuss two key levels that investors should watch as Amazon gets ready for its Q4 earnings presentation. HJBC I am very bullish with respect to the upcoming earnings presentation of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Amazon will report its 4Q-22 earnings on Thursday, February 2, 2023, and I believe the eCommerce company has a good chance of exceeding low profit expectations. I also believe that the outlook for 1Q-23 could be better than expected, and that too much negativity is currently priced into Amazon's valuation. Because the company's stock has a compelling sales valuation, it's a buy both before and after Amazon reports fourth-quarter earnings next week. Earnings Expectations Are Way Too Low If I had to bet on whether Amazon will beat profit estimates for 4Q-22, I would bet that the company will fly past earnings estimates because profit expectations are irrationally low.

HJBC By Breakingviews Amazon.com (AMZN) has rounded up some unusual suspects. The e-commerce goliath recently added to its growing pile of debt with an $8 billion loan. The extra funding is curious, but not as much as the foreign banks providing it. Slowing growth, weakening profitability and planned acquisitions, including 1Life Healthcare and iRobot, are reshaping Amazon’s balance sheet and creating new claims on its resources. It had nearly $60 billion in combined cash and easy-to-sell securities as of Sept. 30, but it also burned through some $20 billion of free cash in the 12 months ending in the third quarter. In that context, raising $8 billion, fast on the heels of arranging a $10 billion term loan in November, seems intuitive for boss Andy Jassy. Less intuitive is the roster of financiers.

        "title": "Can Amazon Recover Amid Tech Stock Sell-off?",
        "content": "Amazon.com Inc NASDAQ: AMZN has rallied over the past month, gaining 19.48%. However, it sits at a loss of 28.95% over the past year. Investors might therefore be wondering where the company will be headed in the future and if the rally in its share is set to continue. Get Amazon.com alerts: Much of that trajectory could come down to how its earnings are received when it publishes its result on Feb 2 next week. Let's look at what the future might have in store for the company. Is Amazon a buy ahead of earnings? Although attempting to time the market is generally unadvisable, the looming recession has been discussed extensively over the past six months, so a lower stock price for Amazon and its peer companies could be on the cards. Some warnings include overvaluation in stocks and commodities, a downward trend in the S&P 500 index, a worse-than-expected rebound of consumer spending in China, and China's real estate prices continuing to fall lower each month. These signs all point towards capitulation in the market being possible to be realized soon. Adding to the pessimism is that executives of Amazon itself may hold a bleak outlook for the future. Plans to let go over 18,000 employees were signed off by Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy this year. However, it's also important to frame these Amazon layoffs correctly. It might not signal that Amazon expects long-term weakness, but rather it could be more of a pivot toward reaching greater efficiency. The stock prices and payrolls of tech companies were severely bloated by COVID-19 stimulus money that would never last long-term. The unexpected turnaround of the virus that came quickly in January last year saw restrictions lift, and the money flowing into these stocks detoured in a different direction. How the layoffs could benefit Amazon Layoffs are needed when business conditions change and the company's experiments don't work as expected. Jassy told Amazon investors that it would lay the groundwork for the company to be more resourceful and instill some vigilance into its operations. This change in tact is a far cry from the splurge in spending seen when liquidity was at an all-time high.

Now the team with almost $600M in exits is planning to list Autonomix on the Nasdaq. And you can invest in Autonomix ahead of their intended Nasdaq listing.* *Disclosure: This is a paid advertisement for Autonomix’s Regulation A+ Offering. Please read the offering circular at invest.autonomix.com Invest in Autonomix today. It's a realistic assessment of where the company is headed towards. Capital.com reported that many of the jobs axed were those in human resources and for its 'experiments' Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh, which did not turn out as expected. If the layoffs did not happen, Amazon might as well light some of its money paying those employees on fire. A large-scale hiring freeze is in place for most of the tech industry, and HR professionals looking over empty desks don't contribute to productivity. The mass layoffs might be one of the largest it has ever seen. But still, we were also in extraordinary and uncertain circumstances with no knowing precisely when the pandemic would reach its peak, and it did so rapidly over the first few weeks of 2022. Another argument is that for investors who can see past the immediate threats in front of them and hold Amazon for a decade or longer, it gives them a more attractive entry for scooping up Amazon shares. For better or worse, the market seems to focus on the here and now at the exclusion of everything else. So let's look at Amazon's potential upside for the future and beyond. Valuation Wall Street seems to have an overwhelming feeling of confidence about Amazon's share, despite it only having a moderate buy rating at the time of writing. 42 analysts who cover it rate it a buy, while it also has 2 hold and 2 sell ratings. One of the biggest things investors could feel confident about is its earnings per share (EPS) is expected to grow from 0.68 per share to $1.58 per share. That's an enormous growth of 132.35%, unheard of for a blue-chip stock in the FAANG acronym. Other positive aspects include that its MarketBeat consensus price target currently sits at $145.41, with analysts predicting that it has a 46.6% potential upside. Like other big names this week, investors will watch Amazon closely for guidance on the rest of the year. This may help to confirm some people's suspicions of the impending recession and its economic impact. Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon.com right now?

        "title": "Want to Invest in a Retail Stock? Ask This Question First.",
        "content": "Retail is a tough business in any economic climate. A small number of retailers -- think Costco (NASDAQ: COST) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) -- manage to build up durable competitive advantages over the course of decades. Most retailers aren't so lucky. Right now, many retail stocks look surprisingly cheap based on trailing earnings. Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (NYSE: BBY) goes for around 13 times earnings, department store Macy's (NYSE: M) trades for less than 5 times earnings, and grocery chain Kroger (NYSE: KR) changes hands for roughly 14 times earnings. Those are not particularly optimistic valuation multiples. Valuation has its limits With persistently high inflation and rising interest rates pressuring consumer spending, retailers in general are likely in for a rough and unpredictable 2023. Even the strongest retailers are starting to face headwinds. Walmart (NYSE: WMT), for example, suffered a gross margin decline in the third quarter of 2022 and guided for a drop in adjusted earnings for the full fiscal year. Many retailers will see their margins contract this year as consumers pull back on spending. While Macy's stock may look extremely inexpensive, for example, it's probably not as cheap as it looks. Analysts are expecting a modest decline in earnings for the company in the upcoming fiscal year, but that could turn out to be far too optimistic. It's a similar story with Best Buy. Despite tumbling demand for PCs and smartphones, analysts still expect a small increase in Best Buy's earnings per share in the upcoming fiscal year. Color me skeptical. Deciding whether or not to invest in a retailer based on past earnings is problematic for two reasons. First, because the past is the past, and second, because the past few years have been pretty weird. An unprecedented shutdown of the economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 was followed by a period of booming demand and free-flowing stimulus. None of that was normal, so basing investment decisions on a retailer's results during that time doesn't make a ton of sense. Basing investment decisions on analyst estimates for future earnings is problematic because analysts are often wrong, and sometimes very wrong. Analyst estimates can be useful, but they certainly shouldn't form the foundation of anyone's investing process. The most important question When I consider investing in a retailer, I naturally take into account valuation, earnings, and growth. But the most important question I ask is this: If the retailer disappeared from the face of the Earth tomorrow, would consumers really care? Amazon: Yes, consumers would definitely care. There are plenty of e-commerce alternatives, but none of them have anywhere close to the product selection of Amazon. People order from Amazon because it's easy, and no other retailer has replicated that. Costco: Yes. While whether shopping at Costco actually saves you money depends on how prone you are to impulse purchases and overspending, consumers certainly believe that the company saves them money. Costco's membership renewal rates are above 90%. Best Buy: I'd say yes, but not nearly as strongly compared Amazon or Costco. Best Buy has transformed itself over the past decade partly by putting a renewed focus on customer service. That's the company's big differentiator, and it's the reason why the retailer holds a somewhat unique place in the U.S. retail market. Macy's: No. There's nothing special about Macy's. There are surely some loyal customers out there, but that's true of every retailer. Macy's finds itself operating in a portion of the department store industry that has little reason to exist. It's not focused on low prices and value like Kohl's or even Target, and it doesn't have the cachet of a higher-end department store like Nordstrom. Kroger: The grocery business has become concentrated among a small number of megachains, so for that reason, consumers would probably care. But in the grocery industry, I like specialized chains like Sprouts that people shop at for reasons other than it being the closest store to their homes. None of this is to say that the best retailers on this list will definitely be great investments, or that the worst retailers on this list will definitely be duds. But if you want the odds to be in your favor, stick with retailers that have some sort of edge, and that customers genuinely like. 10 stocks we like better than Macy's When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

I discuss two key levels that investors should watch as Amazon gets ready for its Q4 earnings presentation. HJBC I am very bullish with respect to the upcoming earnings presentation of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Amazon will report its 4Q-22 earnings on Thursday, February 2, 2023, and I believe the eCommerce company has a good chance of exceeding low profit expectations. I also believe that the outlook for 1Q-23 could be better than expected, and that too much negativity is currently priced into Amazon's valuation. Because the company's stock has a compelling sales valuation, it's a buy both before and after Amazon reports fourth-quarter earnings next week. Earnings Expectations Are Way Too Low If I had to bet on whether Amazon will beat profit estimates for 4Q-22, I would bet that the company will fly past earnings estimates because profit expectations are irrationally low. Amazon is expected to earn only $0.17 per share in the fourth quarter, implying an unreasonably Earnings (Amazon.com In) Moving Averages (Stockcharts.com) AWS Segment Results (Amazon.com Inc) Net Sales (Amazon.com Inc) Valuation (Amazon.com Inc)"

The U.S.-listed shares of ASML Holding N.V. have surged by 12.8%, marking the largest one-day gain in 20 years. This sudden increase comes after the Netherlands-based semiconductor equipment maker announced a new 12 billion euro ($12.2 billion) share repurchase program. According to a consensus among 34 polled investment analysts, it is recommended to buy stock in ASML Holding NV. Despite recent fluctuations in the market, ASML is not significantly more volatile than the rest of Dutch stocks and typically moves +/- 4% a week over the past three months. It is worth noting that ASML Holding’s all-time high closing stock price was $866.41 on September 15, 2021. The current ASML Holding 52-week high stock price is $698.59, which is 7.9% above the current share price. [bs_forecast_slider ticker=”ASML”]’ ASML Holding N.V. Opens Slightly Higher with Stable Performance on May 18, 2023 On May 18, 2023, ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) opened at $675.58, slightly higher than the previous day’s closing price of $670.50. The day’s range for ASML was between $675.25 and $694.31, with a total volume of 35,512 shares traded. ASML’s market capitalization was $255.5 billion, making it one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world. The company has reported negative earnings growth of -12.41% in the past year but has shown positive earnings growth of +33.53% this year. Additionally, ASML is expected to have a 24.00% earnings growth in the next five years. ASML is headquartered in Veldhoven, Noord-Brabant and operates in the electronic technology sector. The company’s industry is semiconductors, which is a rapidly growing industry due to the increasing demand for technology products. In terms of ASML’s financials, the company is expected to report an EPS forecast of $4.98 this quarter, with an annual revenue of $22.3 billion and an annual profit of $5.9 billion. ASML’s net profit margin was 26.56%, which is relatively high compared to other companies in the industry. Overall, ASML’s performance on May 18, 2023, was relatively stable, with a slight increase in the opening price and a moderate trading volume. However, the company’s overvalued stock price and relatively low revenue growth in the past year may be a cause for concern for investors. ASML Holding NVs Stock Performance Predicted to Increase by 11.68% in 12 Months: Analysts On May 18, 2023, ASML Holding NV’s stock performance was closely watched by investors and analysts alike. According to data from CNN Money, the five analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for ASML had a median target of 775.00, with a high estimate of 837.00 and a low estimate of 721.00.

The U.S.-listed shares of ASML Holding N.V. have surged by 12.8%, marking the largest one-day gain in 20 years. This sudden increase comes after the Netherlands-based semiconductor equipment maker announced a new 12 billion euro ($12.2 billion) share repurchase program. According to a consensus among 34 polled investment analysts, it is recommended to buy stock in ASML Holding NV. Despite recent fluctuations in the market, ASML is not significantly more volatile than the rest of Dutch stocks and typically moves +/- 4% a week over the past three months. It is worth noting that ASML Holding’s all-time high closing stock price was $866.41 on September 15, 2021. The current ASML Holding 52-week high stock price is $698.59, which is 7.9% above the current share price. [bs_forecast_slider ticker=”ASML”]’ ASML Holding N.V.

Additionally, ASML is expected to have a 24.00% earnings growth in the next five years. ASML is headquartered in Veldhoven, Noord-Brabant and operates in the electronic technology sector.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on ASML Holding's ROE. Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for ASML Holding How To Calculate Return On Equity? ROE can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for ASML Holding is: 70% = €7.4b ÷ €11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023). The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every €1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated €0.70 in profit. What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth? We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics. ASML Holding's Earnings Growth And 70% ROE Firstly, we acknowledge that ASML Holding has a significantly high ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 18% which is quite remarkable. Under the circumstances, ASML Holding's considerable five year net income growth of 25% was to be expected. As a next step, we compared ASML Holding's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 19%. ENXTAM:ASML Past Earnings Growth July 20th 2023 Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is ASML Holding fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide. Is ASML Holding Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively? The three-year median payout ratio for ASML Holding is 32%, which is moderately low. The company is retaining the remaining 68%. By the looks of it, the dividend is well covered and ASML Holding is reinvesting its profits efficiently as evidenced by its exceptional growth which we discussed above. Besides, ASML Holding has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 32% of its profits over the next three years. As a result, ASML Holding's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 68% for future ROE. Conclusion Overall, we are quite pleased with ASML Holding's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings.

At the current share price of $728.80 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 2.52%. Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 3.42%, the lowest has been 2.43%, and the highest has been 6.93%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.66 (n=236). The current dividend yield is 1.36 standard deviations below the historical average. Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.60. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5. The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is 0.42%, demonstrating that it has increased its dividend over time. Broadcom Background Information (This description is provided by the company.)

Broadcom Declares $4.60 Dividend On March 2, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $4.60 per share ($18.40 annualized). Shareholders of record as of March 22, 2023 received the payment on March 31, 2023. Previously, the company paid $4.60 per share. At the current share price of $728.80 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 2.52%. Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 3.42%, the lowest has been 2.43%, and the highest has been 6.93%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.66 (n=236). The current dividend yield is 1.36 standard deviations below the historical average. Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.60. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5. The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is 0.42%, demonstrating that it has increased its dividend over time. Broadcom Background Information (This description is provided by the company.)

This move is part of a broader trend of insider selling at Broadcom Inc, which we will explore in more detail below. Who is Eddy Hartenstein? Eddy Hartenstein is a seasoned executive with a wealth of experience in the technology and media industries. He has served on the board of directors at Broadcom Inc, a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. His insights and leadership have been instrumental in guiding the company's strategic direction. About Broadcom Inc Broadcom Inc is a leading designer, developer, and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. Broadcom's product portfolio serves critical markets including data center, networking, software, broadband, wireless, and storage and industrial. The company's solutions include data center networking and storage, enterprise, mainframe and cyber security software focused on automation, monitoring and security, smartphone components, telecoms and factory automation. Insider Sell Analysis Over the past year, the insider has sold a total of 4,675 shares and purchased 0 shares. This recent transaction on September 12, 2023, where the insider sold 1,500 shares, is part of this broader trend. The insider transaction history for Broadcom Inc shows a total of 1 insider buy and 11 insider sells over the past year. This suggests a trend towards insider selling at the company. The relationship between insider selling and stock price can be complex. Insider selling does not necessarily indicate a lack of confidence in the company. Insiders may sell shares for personal reasons or to diversify their investment portfolio. However, sustained insider selling over a period of time could be a red flag for investors. Valuation On the day of the insider's recent sell, shares of Broadcom Inc were trading for $855.68 apiece, giving the company a market cap of $359.76 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 26.82, which is higher than the industry median of 23.96 and lower than the company’s historical median price-earnings ratio. With a price of $855.68 and a GuruFocus Value of $666.42, Broadcom Inc has a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 1.28. This suggests that the stock is significantly overvalued based on its GF Value. The GF Value is an intrinsic value estimate developed by GuruFocus. It is calculated based on historical multiples that the stock has traded at, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company’s past returns and growth, and future estimates of business performance from Morningstar analysts. In conclusion, while the insider's recent sell of Broadcom Inc shares is part of a broader trend of insider selling at the company, it does not necessarily indicate a lack of confidence in the company. Investors should consider the company's valuation and other factors when making investment decisions.\n\n---\n\n[2023-12-08] 2023-12-08 13:15:00\n标题: Broadcom: Upgrading To Buy, Soft-Landing Priced In\n内容: We’re upgrading Broadcom to a buy.

It’s how we make money. But our editorial integrity ensures our experts’ opinions aren’t influenced by compensation. Terms may apply to offers listed on this page. KEY POINTS Many Costco members buy rotisserie chickens because they're affordable and make for a stress-free meal solution. The famous warehouse club prices its chickens low to get more customers in the door because most shoppers end up buying much more. Check out our pick for Best No Annual Fee Credit Card of 2023 These chickens are an amazing deal. If you shop at Costco, you may have noticed how affordable the rotisserie chickens are. This item is a cost-effective way to prepare an easy meal, whether you're planning to shred the chicken and use it for soup, make chicken pot pies, or whip up a quick chicken salad. But have you ever wondered why Costco sells its rotisserie chickens for such a low price? Keep reading to find out why this is still one of Costco's best deals. Cheap buys get customers in the door You probably know someone who raves about the prices of Costco's rotisserie chicken -- and for a good reason. It's a steal. Each chicken sold at the store is around three pounds or slightly over, so while you're paying $4.99 for the entire chicken, the per-pound price works out to be $1.66. It's no wonder why so many shoppers stop here for this budget-friendly buy. But why does Costco price this food item so low? Well, Costco wants to entice more people to become members and get more customers in the door. Selling rotisserie chickens at such a low price is a great way to attract more customers. It's a winning strategy for Costco. You're probably going to buy more than chicken Rotisserie chickens are a good bargain, especially for busy families looking for a convenient meal solution that doesn't break the bank. Costco gets you in the door with this deal, but another reason the warehouse club prices its rotisserie chicken so low is they know that you're unlikely to walk off with only a chicken in your cart -- even if you try really hard not to spend more money. Costco is confident that most customers will buy other products while in the store. The retailer even goes as far as to keep its rotisserie chickens in the back of the store, so customers have to pass by other products. Once customers see other available deals and buy more than planned, Costco makes more money. Four tips to avoid overspending at Costco So, you recently invested in a Costco membership but want to avoid buying unnecessary items? It can be easy to overspend if you're not cautious, but there are techniques that you can follow to keep your spending in check. Here are some tips. Make a list: Don't walk in the door without bringing a shopping list. This strategy may help you keep your spending on track as you pass by enticing deals that you don't need. Use the retailer's mobile app to check prices: Before you head to your local club, take a few moments to check prices in the Costco mobile app. You can use the prices shown to plan your shopping list and ensure you don't break your budget before getting to the checkout line. Figure out which items are a deal: Not everything you see at Costco is sold at a bargain price. While items like the rotisserie chickens are a good buy, other items may be priced similarly to traditional retailer prices. Learn what to get at Costco and what items to buy elsewhere to avoid falling for a bad deal. Pay with cash: Using cash is another way to keep your spending in check while at Costco. For some shoppers, paying with cash instead of a credit card is a guaranteed way to avoid overspending -- especially if they only keep so much cash in their wallet. Go ahead and buy that rotisserie chicken at Costco. But don't neglect your personal finance goals in the process. Going in with a plan may help you spend less as you fill your cart with groceries and other essential items. As you develop new shopping habits, it may be easier to make spending decisions that don't negatively impact your checking account balance.\n\n---\n\n[2023-01-04] 2023-01-04 13:08:03\n标题: Why Costco Stock Lost 15% in December\n内容: What happened Shares of Costco Wholesale (COST -1.49%) took a dive last month after the warehouse retail giant posted disappointing comparable sales for November and followed that up with a middling fiscal first-quarter earnings report.

COST data by YCharts So what Costco's worst day of the month came on Dec. 1 when the stock fell 6.6% after it reported November comparable sales with comps adjusted for fuel and currency exchange up just 5.3% globally and 4.6% in the U.S. That marked a noticeable deceleration from earlier in the year, showing that Costco may be feeling the same macro headwinds that much of the rest of the retail sector is. The company also reported another weak round of e-commerce sales, which fell 8.9%. The retailer followed that up with its fiscal first-quarter earnings report the following week with results mostly in line with estimates. Revenue rose 8.1% to $54.44 billion, which was slightly below the analyst consensus at $54.64 billion. On the bottom line, it reported earnings per share of $3.07, up from $2.98 in the quarter a year ago, but just missing estimates at $3.11. Costco's gross margin fell by about 60 basis points, showing it's also struggling to pass along higher costs to consumers in an inflationary environment. However, membership growth, which is the company's primary source of profits, was solid, and management also hinted that a membership fee increase was likely in 2023. Finally, Costco fell another 4% in the broad market sell-off on Dec. 15 after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates again and forecast another 75 basis points of rate hikes in 2023, adding to fears that a recession is coming. Now what Costco reports comparable sales each month and its December report is set to come out on Jan. 5, which will give investors an updated snapshot of the company's performance. Even in a recession, Costco is in a better position than most of its peers because its business is underpinned by its membership model, which gives it a stable income stream. Additionally, its reputation for bargain prices on quality merchandise can help it grow its membership base even in a down economy. Although the stock still seems expensive at a price-to-earnings ratio of 35, there's no question that Costco's business is one of the best in the retail sector, which explains why the stock is trading at a premium.\n\n---\n\n[2023-01-05] 2023-01-05 14:15:00\n标题: Costco Wholesale Corporation Reports December Sales Results\n内容: ISSAQUAH, Wash., Jan. 05, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Costco Wholesale Corporation (“Costco” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: COST) today reported net sales of $23.80 billion for the retail month of December, the five weeks ended January 1, 2023, an increase of 7.0 percent from $22.24 billion last year.

        "content": "Many or all of the products here are from our partners that compensate us. It’s how we make money. But our editorial integrity ensures our experts’ opinions aren’t influenced by compensation. Terms may apply to offers listed on this page. KEY POINTS Many Costco members buy rotisserie chickens because they're affordable and make for a stress-free meal solution. The famous warehouse club prices its chickens low to get more customers in the door because most shoppers end up buying much more. Check out our pick for Best No Annual Fee Credit Card of 2023 These chickens are an amazing deal. If you shop at Costco, you may have noticed how affordable the rotisserie chickens are. This item is a cost-effective way to prepare an easy meal, whether you're planning to shred the chicken and use it for soup, make chicken pot pies, or whip up a quick chicken salad. But have you ever wondered why Costco sells its rotisserie chickens for such a low price? Keep reading to find out why this is still one of Costco's best deals. Cheap buys get customers in the door You probably know someone who raves about the prices of Costco's rotisserie chicken -- and for a good reason. It's a steal. Each chicken sold at the store is around three pounds or slightly over, so while you're paying $4.99 for the entire chicken, the per-pound price works out to be $1.66. It's no wonder why so many shoppers stop here for this budget-friendly buy. But why does Costco price this food item so low? Well, Costco wants to entice more people to become members and get more customers in the door. Selling rotisserie chickens at such a low price is a great way to attract more customers. It's a winning strategy for Costco. You're probably going to buy more than chicken Rotisserie chickens are a good bargain, especially for busy families looking for a convenient meal solution that doesn't break the bank. Costco gets you in the door with this deal, but another reason the warehouse club prices its rotisserie chicken so low is they know that you're unlikely to walk off with only a chicken in your cart -- even if you try really hard not to spend more money. Costco is confident that most customers will buy other products while in the store. The retailer even goes as far as to keep its rotisserie chickens in the back of the store, so customers have to pass by other products. Once customers see other available deals and buy more than planned, Costco makes more money. Four tips to avoid overspending at Costco So, you recently invested in a Costco membership but want to avoid buying unnecessary items? It can be easy to overspend if you're not cautious, but there are techniques that you can follow to keep your spending in check. Here are some tips. Make a list: Don't walk in the door without bringing a shopping list. This strategy may help you keep your spending on track as you pass by enticing deals that you don't need. Use the retailer's mobile app to check prices: Before you head to your local club, take a few moments to check prices in the Costco mobile app. You can use the prices shown to plan your shopping list and ensure you don't break your budget before getting to the checkout line. Figure out which items are a deal: Not everything you see at Costco is sold at a bargain price. While items like the rotisserie chickens are a good buy, other items may be priced similarly to traditional retailer prices. Learn what to get at Costco and what items to buy elsewhere to avoid falling for a bad deal. Pay with cash: Using cash is another way to keep your spending in check while at Costco. For some shoppers, paying with cash instead of a credit card is a guaranteed way to avoid overspending -- especially if they only keep so much cash in their wallet. Go ahead and buy that rotisserie chicken at Costco. But don't neglect your personal finance goals in the process. Going in with a plan may help you spend less as you fill your cart with groceries and other essential items. As you develop new shopping habits, it may be easier to make spending decisions that don't negatively impact your checking account balance."

Costco Wholesale's COST short percent of float has risen 20.0% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 5.31 million shares sold short, which is 1.2% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 3.04 days to cover their short positions on average. Why Short Interest Matters Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises. Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Costco Wholesale Short Interest Graph (3 Months) As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Costco Wholesale has grown since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to fall in the near-term but traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted. Comparing Costco Wholesale's Short Interest Against Its Peers Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis. According to Benzinga Pro, Costco Wholesale's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 4.29%, which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers.

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow. As of 2023-12-04, Costco Wholesale Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $274.06. It's currently trading at a price of $596.22. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -117.55%. The company is significantly overvalued. The model The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Costco Wholesale Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps. Assumptions Term Value Explanation EPS without NRI $14.11 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.25%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 12.90% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation. Calculation Growth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 155.12 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 118.94 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 274.06 Discounted Free Cash Flow Model GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $395.64. This valuation indicates that the Costco Wholesale Corp is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -50.7%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page. The Bottom Line Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model: Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings. Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value. Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized. Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate. Navigating with GuruFocus: Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).

Here's what you need to know. NET INCOME: The big-box retailer is expected to report a profit of $1.52 billion, compared with $1.36 billion, according to the consensus of nine analysts polled by FactSet. REVENUE: Costco's revenue for the fiscal first quarter is expected to rise to $57.79 billion from $54.44 billion a year ago, according to 25 analysts polled by FactSet. ADJUSTED EARNINGS: Stripping out certain one-time items, the company is expected to post a profit of $3.41 a share in the quarter ended Nov. 26, according to the consensus of 29 analysts polled by FactSet. Costco's stock rose 8.7% in the quarter and was recently trading at $636 a share. WHAT TO WATCH -- Costco has not raised its membership price since 2017, and analysts think the company is due for another hike. Management said after fiscal fourth quarter results that it could not say whether a membership fee increase was in its plans for the next fiscal year. Investors will be looking for a fee raise, or, if not, signs of when that increase might come. -- Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon warned in November that the retailer could be dealing with deflation in the months to come. Costco, which like Walmart sells food, clothes and hard goods, may offer some insight on how prices are faring in different categories. Price deflation would hurt Costco's margins, but may boost consumer confidence and willingness to buy discretionary items. -- Costco, which reports sales results every month, said in November that its online comparable sales accelerated in the four weeks ended Nov. 20, growing 9.9% from a year ago. The retailer will likely offer new signals of its performance during the early part of the holiday shopping season.

        "content": "Loading... Loading... Costco Wholesale's COST short percent of float has risen 20.0% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 5.31 million shares sold short, which is 1.2% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 3.04 days to cover their short positions on average. Why Short Interest Matters Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises. Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish. See Also: List of the most shorted stocks Loading... Loading... Costco Wholesale Short Interest Graph (3 Months) As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Costco Wholesale has grown since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to fall in the near-term but traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted. Comparing Costco Wholesale's Short Interest Against Its Peers Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis. According to Benzinga Pro, Costco Wholesale's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 4.29%, which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers. Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock? This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.

        "title": "Navigating Market Uncertainty: Intrinsic Value of Costco Wholesale Corp",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a look into Costco Wholesale Corp's (COST, Financial) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow. As of 2023-12-04, Costco Wholesale Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $274.06. It's currently trading at a price of $596.22. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -117.55%. The company is significantly overvalued. The model The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Costco Wholesale Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps. Assumptions Term Value Explanation EPS without NRI $14.11 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.25%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 12.90% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation. Calculation Growth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 155.12 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 118.94 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 274.06 Discounted Free Cash Flow Model GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $395.64. This valuation indicates that the Costco Wholesale Corp is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -50.7%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page. The Bottom Line Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model: Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings. Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.

It’s how we make money. But our editorial integrity ensures our experts’ opinions aren’t influenced by compensation. Terms may apply to offers listed on this page. There's nothing like being an insider. Costco employees see it all, from members who return half-dead houseplants to how the retailer adds secret price codes to discounted items. Here, we've gathered insider secrets from around the web, each generously shared by a Costco employee. 1. Don't have a Visa Card? That's okay There's a lot to like about Costco, but one thing that bugs the daylights out of some people is that Visa is the only credit card the retailer accepts. Let's say you limit the number of credit cards in your wallet and don't happen to carry a Visa. One insider tip reminds shoppers who want to use another credit card to shop online whenever possible. Costco.com will accept any card, including MasterCard and American Express. 2. Some price stickers indicate a deeper discount Most prices in the warehouse store end in $._9 (for example, $2.39 or $2.99). When you find a price that ends in $.00, $.88, or $.97, it means it's on sale. Normally, these are items that have either been returned or have damaged packaging. In either case, it's a good way to leave a little extra in your bank account. Before putting it in your cart, though, give the item in question a quick once-over to make sure it's otherwise in good shape. 3. Kirkland products are not always the best choice According to one Costco employee, some Kirkland Signature™ products live up to the hype. For example, the quality of Kirkland bacon and maple syrup can't be beat. On the other hand, it may be best to leave Kirkland dishwasher gel packs on the shelf. It may take a little comparison shopping to figure out which brand offers you the biggest bang for your buck. 4. Wade into the heart of the store The best deals are almost always found deep in the heart of the store. One helpful employee suggests starting at the center of the store and working your way to the back. That's where you're most likely to find the best deals. You may want to be careful about purchasing items from the front of the store, because those products tend to have the highest markups. 5. Want to buy soda? Check your local supermarket first While there's nothing wrong with soda prices at Costco, you're likely to find a better deal at a local grocery store. That's because grocery stores often use soda as a loss leader. In other words, they sell it below cost to draw customers into the store. Buying soda in bulk when your local market offers it at a discount will likely save you money. 6. Spring for an executive membership Insider.com spoke with a longtime Costco employee who suggested signing up for an executive membership. While it's twice the cost of a standard gold star membership, an executive membership offers 2% back on most purchases, including the tire shop, pharmacy, optical, and hearing-aid services. An executive cardholder can receive as much as $1,000 back on qualified purchases. Tip: Springing for an executive membership only makes sense if you spend $3,000 per year or more at Costco. If you're an occasional shopper, you're better off sticking with a basic membership. 7. Stock up on products marked with an asterisk If you see an asterisk on the upper-right corner of a price sticker, it means Costco will not be restocking that item. If it's something you enjoy, you may want to stock up while you can. Finally, several Costco employees implore members not to tear through the spare boxes found at the front of many Costco locations. Take what you need, but leave the rest as neat as you found them. That way, employees won't have to take time to gather boxes that have been strewn about. There are few things better in life than getting the inside scoop from someone who knows the lay of the land. And money saving tips are especially welcomed.\n\n---\n\n[2023-05-23] 2023-05-23 00:00:00\n标题: Costco Life Insurance Review\n内容: By clicking “Accept All Cookies”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.\n\n---\n\n[2023-05-24] 2023-05-24 10:00:00\n标题: Costco Wholesale's Earnings: A Preview\n内容: Costco Wholesale COST is set to give its latest quarterly earnings report on Thursday, 2023-05-25.

The retailer is expected to have benefitted from rising memberships in the to-be-reported quarter. Nevertheless, given the inflationary pressures, Costco may have been impacted by lower demand for discretionary products and a slowdown in e-commerce. Overall, the Street expects Costco to post earnings of $3.29 per share in Q3, nearly 8% higher than the prior-year period figure of $3.04. Meanwhile, revenue is pegged at $54.5 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 3.6%. Earlier in May, Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe reiterated a Buy rating on Costco following its April sales data. In Tarlowe’s opinion, Costco benefits from its “channel shift from traditional grocery, department stores, and specialty retail.” Additionally, he sees it as a plus that the business can draw in customers of all ages with its alluring membership club products. Is COST Stock a Good Buy? Wall Street is cautiously optimistic about Costco stock. It has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 17 Buys and seven Holds. The average stock price target of $540.55 implies 11.5% upside potential. COST stock is up 7.4% so far this year. Ending Thoughts Costco’s ability to expand globally by opening 27 new stores in 2023 should support the retailer’s top and bottom line figures. Furthermore, the company’s value pricing strategy and loyal customer base position it well to perform well amid all market conditions.

Stay up to date on Costco Wholesale analyst ratings. How Are Analyst Ratings Determined? Ratings come from analysts, or specialists within banking and financial systems that report for specific stocks or defined sectors (typically once per quarter for each stock). Analysts usually derive their information from company conference calls and meetings, financial statements, and conversations with important insiders to reach their decisions. Some analysts publish their predictions for metrics such as growth estimates, earnings, and revenue to provide additional guidance with their ratings. When using analyst ratings, it is important to keep in mind that stock and sector analysts are also human and are only offering their opinions to investors.

        "title": "7 Costco Pro Tips From Longtime Employees",
        "content": "Many or all of the products here are from our partners that compensate us. It’s how we make money. But our editorial integrity ensures our experts’ opinions aren’t influenced by compensation. Terms may apply to offers listed on this page. There's nothing like being an insider. Costco employees see it all, from members who return half-dead houseplants to how the retailer adds secret price codes to discounted items. Here, we've gathered insider secrets from around the web, each generously shared by a Costco employee. 1. Don't have a Visa Card? That's okay There's a lot to like about Costco, but one thing that bugs the daylights out of some people is that Visa is the only credit card the retailer accepts. Let's say you limit the number of credit cards in your wallet and don't happen to carry a Visa. One insider tip reminds shoppers who want to use another credit card to shop online whenever possible. Costco.com will accept any card, including MasterCard and American Express. 2. Some price stickers indicate a deeper discount Most prices in the warehouse store end in $._9 (for example, $2.39 or $2.99). When you find a price that ends in $.00, $.88, or $.97, it means it's on sale. Normally, these are items that have either been returned or have damaged packaging. In either case, it's a good way to leave a little extra in your bank account. Before putting it in your cart, though, give the item in question a quick once-over to make sure it's otherwise in good shape. 3. Kirkland products are not always the best choice According to one Costco employee, some Kirkland Signature™ products live up to the hype. For example, the quality of Kirkland bacon and maple syrup can't be beat. On the other hand, it may be best to leave Kirkland dishwasher gel packs on the shelf. It may take a little comparison shopping to figure out which brand offers you the biggest bang for your buck. 4. Wade into the heart of the store The best deals are almost always found deep in the heart of the store. One helpful employee suggests starting at the center of the store and working your way to the back. That's where you're most likely to find the best deals. You may want to be careful about purchasing items from the front of the store, because those products tend to have the highest markups. 5. Want to buy soda? Check your local supermarket first While there's nothing wrong with soda prices at Costco, you're likely to find a better deal at a local grocery store. That's because grocery stores often use soda as a loss leader. In other words, they sell it below cost to draw customers into the store. Buying soda in bulk when your local market offers it at a discount will likely save you money. 6. Spring for an executive membership Insider.com spoke with a longtime Costco employee who suggested signing up for an executive membership. While it's twice the cost of a standard gold star membership, an executive membership offers 2% back on most purchases, including the tire shop, pharmacy, optical, and hearing-aid services. An executive cardholder can receive as much as $1,000 back on qualified purchases. Tip: Springing for an executive membership only makes sense if you spend $3,000 per year or more at Costco. If you're an occasional shopper, you're better off sticking with a basic membership. 7. Stock up on products marked with an asterisk If you see an asterisk on the upper-right corner of a price sticker, it means Costco will not be restocking that item. If it's something you enjoy, you may want to stock up while you can. Finally, several Costco employees implore members not to tear through the spare boxes found at the front of many Costco locations. Take what you need, but leave the rest as neat as you found them. That way, employees won't have to take time to gather boxes that have been strewn about. There are few things better in life than getting the inside scoop from someone who knows the lay of the land. And money saving tips are especially welcomed."

(NASDAQ:TTEC) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript\n内容: TTEC Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTEC) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript November 9, 2023 Operator: Welcome to TTEC's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded at the request of TTEC. I would now like to turn the call over to Paul Miller, TTEC's Senior Vice President, Treasurer, and Investor Relations Officer. Thank you. Sir, you may begin. Paul Miller : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. TTEC is hosting this call to discuss its third quarter financial results for the period ended September 30, 2023. Participating on today's call are Ken Tuchman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TTEC; Shelly Swanback, Chief Executive Officer of TTEC Engage and President of TTEC; and Francois Bourret, Interim Chief Financial Officer of TTEC. Yesterday, TTEC issued a press release announcing its financial results. While this call will reflect items discussed within that document, for complete information about our financial performance, we also encourage you to read our third quarter 2023 quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Before we begin, I want to remind you that matters discussed on today's call may include forward-looking statements related to our operating performance, financial goals and business outlook, which are based on management's current beliefs and assumptions. Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to revise this information as a result of new developments that may occur. Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected and described today. For a more detailed description of our risk factors, please review our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K. A replay of this conference call will be available on our website under the Investor Relations section. I will now turn the call over to Ken. Story continues Kenneth Tuchman : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. This quarter, we continued to focus on delivering high-value CX outcomes for our clients and seamless technology-enabled experiences for their customers. In this current challenging environment, I am proud that our global team delivered on our Q3 forecast and that we have met or exceeded overall expectations each quarter year-to-date. Turning now to our third quarter consolidated results. Revenue was $603 million. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted EBITDA was $64 million, operating income was $47 million and EPS was $0.48. There is no question that businesses are operating in a state of unprecedented and accelerating change. The macroeconomic factors that we have been discussing for the last several quarters are unfortunately now playing out. Contributing factors include higher interest rates that are expected to last longer, ongoing inflation above target rates, labor strengths in multiple industries, looming student loan payments, inconsistent consumer spending habits, and geopolitical unrest. With all this uncertainty, it's no surprise that businesses and consumer confidence is beginning to fade and overall sentiment continues to decline. Every day, it's getting harder for businesses to predict and rely on their traditional indicators to plan for the future. While the economy may not technically be in a recession, many of our clients are now operating as though we are. Given all these factors, we're updating our outlook for Q4 and guidance for the full year. Clients are scrutinizing the dollars they spend. They're focusing their attention and resources on initiatives that are urgent, essential, and will have an immediate and predictable financial benefit on their business. The impact on us is mixed. For some of our clients, this mindset is delaying decision-making or driving last-minute unexpected changes in forecast as they prepare for future headwinds. Conversely, for other clients, these pressures are steering them towards options like offshoring, process improvements, and technology innovations, all areas where TTEC excels. While the current dynamics may be temporarily uncertain, we maintain our conviction that CX is a business imperative, a brand differentiator, and will be a strategic driver of growth and profitability for decades to come. Although the sector is currently somewhat challenged, I want to reiterate our confidence in the attractiveness of the market opportunity, our differentiated capabilities and our strategy to drive TTEC forward. We are navigating this environment thoughtfully, and we'll continue to balance our focus on innovation with operational and financial rigor. Shelly will share more details shortly. Now, on to a discussion around AI. Last quarter, we outlined our AI strategy across both TTEC Engage and TTEC Digital, and we're making good progress. Market interest in AI remains high. However, implementation has been primarily limited to pilots. Many clients see the potential benefits. However, they currently lack the technology infrastructure, data readiness, and confidence that these initiatives can scale in a cost-effective and reliable manner. The findings of our recent AI benchmark study reflect the current limited state of market and client readiness. For example, one, for businesses to unlock the full benefit of AI, they must move to the cloud. However, almost half the respondents to our study expressed concern about their technology platform readiness and only a small fraction are operating at a scale in the cloud. Number two, the ability to understand and act on insights from conversational intelligence is essential to achieve the right balance in automation and human interaction. However, close to 75% of the respondents cite issues around data quality and customer privacy as current barriers to their success. And three, while new generative AI-enabled tools are emerging daily to augment associate productivity, only a few of our study respondents have even begun the pilot capabilities like proactive knowledge management, AI-generated response, and real-time coaching. It is clear that the initial hype and early excitement around AI is moderating. As clients look beyond pilots, they're discovering that they need deep and practical CX expertise like ours to put these new AI-enabled capabilities to work. Through TTEC Digital, TTEC Engage, and our deep partnerships with the hyperscalers, we're uniquely positioned and ready to capture the opportunity as the market and technologies continue to evolve and mature. Now, let me briefly update you on several other key initiatives. We continue to expand our geographic footprint to provide clients with a variety of high-quality, lower-cost solutions. We've been operating on 5 continents for decades, and we continue to grow. Year-to-date, we've expanded to 8 new offshore locations with more on horizon. In addition, through TTEC Digital, we continue to broaden our global delivery capabilities, particularly in India, doubling the size of our Hyderabad engineering team since the start of the year. Our strategic relationships with the premier CX technology partners continues to grow stronger, stickier, and more valuable. With preferred status with all the CX hyperscalers, we're working together to pioneer new AI-based solutions, accelerate market adoption, and expand our global reach. For example, given our extensive public sector experience, we're working with one of our hyperscaler strategic partners to help them navigate the complexity of public sector operations. Our engineers are supporting them in the development of their comprehensive roadmap for FedRAMP certification. For another hyperscaler, we're working side-by-side to architect next-generation AI-enabled workforce optimization capabilities for their CCaaS platform. Before I turn it over to Shelly, I'd like to share a few closing comments. There is no doubt that every business, including ours, is operating in a rapidly changing and complex environment. However, it's important to emphasize that over the past 41 years, TTEC has successfully navigated challenging economic cycles and technological disruptions before. Because of our trusted relationships with clients, market reputation as an innovator and leader and the dedication of our employees across the globe, we've emerged stronger every time. As we move ahead in this climate, I'm confident in our leadership and go-forward strategy. Our focused approach will continue to enable us to deliver valuable CX outcomes for our clients, differentiated experiences for their customers, compelling career opportunities for our employees, and improved financial performance for our shareholders. And now, I'll hand it over to Shelly. Shelly Swanback: Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our performance year-to-date, but let me begin my comments by addressing the impact of the dynamic macroeconomic environment and our change in full-year guidance. This quarter, a few of our engaged clients made sudden changes to their forecast due to their business conditions. Those actions will unfortunately impact our fourth quarter and full-year results. And while Digital exceeded Q3 guidance, delayed client decisions will impact their Q4 revenue. Not surprisingly, market uncertainty was a theme in our recent client advisory meeting. While they couldn't speak to individual clients daily, hearing our voices together amplified several things. CX remains a priority. However, in this climate, clients are carefully focusing their investments on initiatives with an immediate financial payoff. Cost pressures are challenging clients to do things very differently. Clients will lean into partners like us who have the skills, tools, and experience to guide them as the landscape continues to evolve. They value our ability to provide a variety of nearshore and offshore locations, CX technology solutions and practical services that will rapidly impact their bottom line. Generative AI continues to generate interest. While clients are excited about the potential, they're seeking proven use cases before they move forward with full force. This is especially true in regulated and complex industries. And as Ken mentioned earlier, we're making good progress on our AI strategy that we outlined last quarter. We're actively partnering with clients in both TTEC Digital and TTEC Engage to better understand how to responsibly and affordably scale what we're learning from successful pilots. We currently have dozens of projects in flight. For example, this quarter, we collaborated with an auto OEM in Europe on a conversational AI effort. We captured and analyzed intents to define optimal routing strategies in real-time. Enabled across 15 languages, the initiatives delivered dramatic improvements, including 24/7 availability, a faster response time, a lower handle time, and over $1 million in projected cost savings annually. In healthcare, we're partnering with the payer to shorten their sales cycle by integrating generative AI into the pre-enrollment process. Our consulting team is lending data with a human-centered design approach to ensure that every interaction is handled with an optimal balance of empathy and convenience. We're also applying AI across our business internally. We're using LLMs and knowledge assist applications to improve the efficiency of our internal help desk, complex analytic models to evaluate new hire candidates, voice detect processing to speed up desktop administration, and AI for marketing segmentation and creative development. Using AI responsibly across our business is one of our highest priorities. Ultimately, we'll touch everything we do. I look forward to sharing additional progress on all of our AI initiatives in the quarters to come. Now on to business update for TTEC Digital. A business executive reviewing customer analytics on their laptop in a modern office. We exceeded our Q3 guidance, closing 14 new logos as we continue to help clients improve the quality of their customer experiences with CX technology. Revenue including product sales was up for the quarter 15%. Growth in our recurring managed services, which makes up 50% of our digital revenue, continues to be driven by a high percentage of client renewals as well as new logos, particularly in our Genesys practice. Elongated sales cycles impacted our professional services revenue this quarter and into next quarter. While some companies are delaying their technology modernization plans, many are faced with end-of-life platform decisions that require action. Encouragingly, we are starting to see several opportunities that were delayed moving through our pipeline. To that end, we expect solid Q4 bookings that have nearly 70 migration initiatives in our pipeline compared to 38 migrations completed so far this year. As we move forward, we will continue to leverage our differentiated position in TTEC Digital. We employ some of the most tenured expertise in CCaaS, CRM, and analytics across the globe. With several thousand specialized engineers, we've implemented more CX solutions than anyone. And with our growing offshore innovation center in Hyderabad, we're building a profitable and scalable mix of onshore and offshore talent. Moving on to Engage. This quarter, we continue to make progress on our strategic priorities, win new clients, and expand with existing clients. Third quarter revenue reflects continued solid demand in healthcare, financial services, and public sector. Revenue from these verticals grew 7%. However, as I mentioned earlier, some Engage client decisions negatively impacted the results and our outlook for the fourth quarter. Specifically, our fourth quarter seasonal business will not grow as expected given client response to the macro factors discussed earlier and an isolated situation with one financially challenged client. Additionally, a few clients in the telecom sector changed their forecast in response to reduced customer demand from lackluster mobile technology and product releases. From a margin perspective, it goes without saying that we're actively adjusting supply and demand for these client programs and continue to implement cost-related actions in response to the overall environment. We expect these efforts to have a more meaningful impact in 2024 and look forward to sharing more details with you on our Q4 call. Now, moving on to some highlights for the quarter. Engage closed 10 new logos across a variety of services and industry verticals, including healthcare and financial services, technology, and retail. More than half of these new logos will be delivered offshore. Additionally, more than half of our expansion with the existing clients will be delivered offshore as well. And we established our presence in Malaysia and Thailand with additional Asian language support. While offshore deal sizes are generally smaller, we're pleased that our expanded language capabilities and geographic presence are resonating with our clients. Our offshore pipeline is up more than 50% compared to last year. Now for some overall closing comments before I hand it over to Francois, we believe that the challenging macro conditions will persist through the end of this year and into early 2024. In both Digital and Engage, we're keenly focused on managing everything in our control to capitalize on market opportunities, while operating an agile platform and in a prudent approach to cost management. With our portfolio of clients, technology and talent, we're confident about our future. On behalf of our Board, our leadership team, and 65,000 employees across the globe, thank you for your continued support. Now, over to you, Francois. Francois Bourret : Thank you, Shelly, and good morning. I will start by addressing our third quarter financial results before sharing additional context into our updated fourth quarter and full-year 2023 financial outlook. In my discussion on the third quarter financial results, reference to revenue is on a GAAP basis, while EBITDA, operating income, and earnings per share are on a non-GAAP adjusted basis. A full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the tables attached to our earnings press release. TTEC's consolidated third quarter financial results are in line with our previously provided guidance. Our Digital segment exceeded expectations, while our Engage segment faced some softness around specific areas that will also impact our fourth quarter outlook. For our third quarter consolidated financial results, revenue was $603 million compared to $592 million in the prior year period, representing 0.8% growth on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $64 million or 10.6% of revenue compared to $68.5 million or 11.6% in the prior year. Operating income was $47 million or 7.8% of revenue compared to $50 million or 8.5% in the prior year. And EPS was $0.48 compared to $0.68 in the prior year. In the third quarter, foreign exchange movement over the prior year period positively impacted revenue by $6 million, and negatively impacted operating income by $1 million. The year-over-year decrease in operating and EBITDA margins was primarily a function of lower Engage revenue driven by sudden changes in client demand, creating temporary stranded costs. On the other hand, we continue to rationalize and optimize resources to maintain an agile cost structure. Turning to our third quarter segment performance. Digital financial performance was above our forecast for the quarter. Our Digital segment reported third quarter 2023 revenue of $133 million, an increase of 14.7% over the prior year period. Operating income was $19 million or 14.5% of revenue compared to $16 million or 13.6% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding the Cisco practice and one-time product sales, the Digital business grew 7% year-over-year in the third quarter. Our Digital core operating efficiencies contributed to the improved overall operating margin. The recurring managed services revenue grew 4% in the third quarter over the same period last year, and represents more than 50% of Digital's total revenue. If we exclude the Cisco decline for the same period, managed services increased by nearly 20%. In the third quarter, Cisco represented 29% of our recurring revenue, down from over 50% just a couple of years ago. One-time product sales in the quarter were associated with the acceleration of CX infrastructure investments and were a key contributor to this quarter growth, including $5 million brought forward from the fourth quarter. Our Engage segment reported third quarter 2023 revenue of $470 million, a decrease of 2.6% on a constant currency basis over the prior year. This financial performance was below our forecast shared for the third quarter. Representing 53% of Engage revenue, the healthcare, pub sec, and financial services verticals are growing organically by 7% in the third quarter of 2023, despite the lower demand than anticipated for seasonal work, modestly impacting the third quarter, but having a greater impact in the fourth quarter. It represents the primary reason for the Engage revenue shortfall relative to the previous midpoint of our guidance. In the third quarter, operating income was $28 million or 5.9% of revenue compared to $34 million or 7.2% in the prior year. Our Engage operating margin is primarily a function of the aforementioned factors impacting revenue and associated near-term costs. Margins also reflect the planned strategic investments that we continue to make to expand our offshore delivery footprint. I will now share other third quarter 2023 measures before discussing our outlook. Cash flow from operations in the third quarter was a negative $32 million compared to a positive $28 million in the prior year period. The more timely collection of receivables over last year was more than offset by timing of certain accounts payable, payroll, higher interest expense, and lower profitability. Year-to-date, our free cash flow increased by $4 million to $59 million over the prior year period, despite a $34 million increase in net interest expense over the prior 9-month period. Capital expenditures were $22 million or 3.6% of revenue for the third quarter 2023 compared to $29 million or 4.9% in the prior year period. The reduction is primarily a function of reduced facility related in renovations and IT equipment purchases on behalf of clients. As of September 30, 2023, cash was $152 million with $967 million of debt, of which $964 million represented borrowings under our $1.5 billion credit facility. Year-over-year, net debt increased by $29 million to $816 million, primarily related to capital distributions and acquisition-related payments, partially offset by the positive free cash flow. Our capital allocation remains focused on investments that support our strategic initiatives as well as the service of our debt and shareholder returns. TTEC paid a $0.52 per share or $24.7 million semiannual dividend on October 31, 2023 to shareholders of record as of October 16, 2023. Turning to our fourth quarter and full-year 2023 outlook. We have lowered the range of our full-year guidance based on our updated outlook for the fourth quarter. On a consolidated basis, we now expect full-year revenue to be in the range of $2.43 billion and $2.45 billion, relatively flat with the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin percentage to be in the range of 11.1% and 11.4% and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.11 to $2.27. The earlier tax estimate decreases to 24% and interest expenses remain unchanged. Please refer to the third quarter earnings press release for the updated guidance range. I will now provide additional context into our updated outlook at the segment level, primarily driven by client actions due to the uncertain environment. Digital's fourth quarter outlook reduced our full-year revenue guidance by $50 million, driven by the timing impact from the longer sales cycle and delayed bookings, especially for professional services. Based on quarter-to-date pipeline conversions, we anticipate solid Digital professional services bookings in the fourth quarter. In addition, excluding Cisco services and one-time product sales, our digital business is anticipated to grow 5% year-over-year per our fourth quarter outlook. Finally, the margin shortfall from lower revenue will be offset by greater execution and efficiencies attributable to our strong offshore footprint and cost rationalization aligning with our long-term strategy. Turning to Engage. The fourth quarter revenue outlook explains the $42 million reduction to our full-year revenue guidance, reflecting the level of uncertainty. 60% of our revenue change to our prior guidance is explained by the moderated level of seasonal reward in healthcare and public sector relative to our earlier growth expectation. The balance of the revenue reduction came from the telco vertical for the reasons shared by Shelly. From a margin standpoint, our guidance range reflects the isolated credit risk of the client mentioned by Shelly and a temporary supply and demand imbalance. As we rebalance staffing levels with demand, our operating costs will return to normalized levels by year-end. In addition, we have also accelerated other cost takeout initiatives in the fourth quarter that will primarily benefit margins in 2024. TTEC's overall pipeline for the next 6 months continues to be above $1 billion, which is well diversified across verticals, geographies, and CX service offerings. In closing, we're pleased with our year-to-date results. However, the rapidly changing macroeconomic uncertainties impacted a number of our clients, and in turn, put downward pressure on our financial outlook for the next months. As a result, and until the economic environment and visibility improves, we will continue to apply a conservative view, driven by the weakening consumer demand and higher for longer interest rates. Longer term, we continue to view the fundamentals of our business and the value proposition we provide as exceptionally durable. As we're pivoting to 2024, we remain keenly focused on our strategic priorities that will deliver profitable growth. We look forward to providing our full-year 2024 outlook when we announce our fourth quarter earnings results at the end of February. I will now turn the call back to Paul. Paul Miller : Thanks, Francois. As we open up the call, we ask that you limit your questions to one at a time. Operator, you may now open the line.

Considerable gaps exist across six key business pillars — strategy, infrastructure, data, governance, talent and culture — with only nine per cent of companies saying they are fully ready to integrate AI into their businesses. Companies are racing against time as 55 per cent said they have a maximum of one year to deploy their AI strategy or else it will have a negative impact on business. Toronto, Canada, Nov. 14, 2023 — Only nine per cent of Canadian organizations are fully prepared to deploy and leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered technologies, according to Cisco’s (NASDAQ: CSCO) inaugural AI Readiness Index released today. The Index, which surveyed over 8,000 global companies, was developed in response to the accelerating adoption of AI, a generational shift that is impacting almost every area of business and daily life. The report highlights companies’ preparedness to utilize and deploy AI, showcasing critical gaps across key business pillars and infrastructures that pose serious risks for the near future. The new research finds that while AI adoption has been slowly progressing for decades, the advancements in Generative AI, coupled with public availability in the past year, are driving greater attention to the challenges, changes and new possibilities posed by the technology. While 78 per cent of respondents believe AI will have a significant impact on their business operations, it also raises new issues around data privacy and security. The findings show that companies experience the most challenges when it comes to leveraging AI alongside their data. In fact, 83 per cent of respondents admit that this is due to data existing in silos across their organizations. However, there is also positive news. Data shows that companies in Canada are taking proactive measures to prepare for an AI-centric future. When it comes to building AI strategies, 95 per cent of organizations already have an AI strategy in place or in the process of developing one. In this category, over two thirds (68 per cent) of organizations are classified as either Pacesetters or Chasers (fully/partially prepared), with only six per cent falling into the category of Laggards (not prepared). This could be driven by the fact that most (96 per cent) respondents said the urgency to deploy AI technologies in their organization has increased in the past six months, with IT infrastructure and cybersecurity reported as the top priority areas for AI deployments. “Canada is experiencing a significant gap in its ability to adopt, deploy and capitalize on AI’s full potential. Business leaders must think beyond the here-and-now, looking ahead to their needs and building the infrastructure to match,” said Shannon Leininger, President of Cisco Canada. “Businesses need to holistically consider the elements of AI readiness so that we can not only take hold of all that AI has to offer, but do so responsibly.” Some of the most significant findings include: URGENCY: Businesses know they must act. Fifty-five per cent of respondents in Canada believe they have a maximum of one year to implement an AI strategy before their organization begins to incur significant negative business impact. STRATEGY: Step one is strategy, and organizations are well on their way. Sixty-eight per cent of organizations were benchmarked as either Pacesetters or Chasers, and only six per cent were found to be Laggards. Additionally, 93 per cent of organizations already have a defined AI strategy in place or are in the process of developing one, which is a positive sign, but shows there is more to do. INFRASTRUCTURE: Networks aren’t equipped to meet AI workloads. Ninety-five per cent of businesses globally are aware that AI will increase infrastructure workloads, but in Canada only 33 per cent of organizations consider their infrastructure highly scalable. Over a half (55 per cent) of companies have moderate or limited scalability when it comes to meeting new AI challenges within their current IT infrastructures. To accommodate AI’s increased power and computing demands, over two thirds (79 per cent) of companies will require further data center graphics processing units (GPUs) to support current and future AI workloads. DATA: Organizations cannot neglect the importance of ‘AI-ready’ data. While data serves as the backbone needed for AI operations, it is also the area where readiness is the weakest, with the greatest number of Laggards (18 per cent) compared to other pillars. Eighty-three per cent of Canadian respondents claim some degree of siloed or fragmented data in their organization. This poses a critical challenge as the complexity of integrating data that resides in various sources and making it available for AI implications can impact the ability to leverage the full potential of these applications. TALENT: The need for AI skills reveals a new-age digital divide. While 87 per cent of respondents said they are planning to invest in upskilling existing employees, 21 per cent alluded to an emerging AI divide, expressing doubt about the availability of enough talent to upskill. GOVERNANCE: AI policy adoption’s slow start. Only 29 per cent of respondents said they have highly comprehensive AI policies in place, an area that must be addressed as companies consider and govern all the factors that present a risk in eroding confidence and trust. These factors include data privacy and data sovereignty, and the understanding of, and compliance with, global regulations. Additionally, close attention must be paid to the concepts of bias, fairness, and transparency in both data and algorithms. CULTURE: Little preparation, but high motivation to make a priority. This pillar had the lowest number of Pacesetters (four per cent) compared to other categories. Twenty-seven per cent of companies have not established change management plans yet and of those that have, 68 per cent are still in-progress. But motivation is high. Three quarters (75 per cent) say their organization is embracing AI with a moderate to high level of urgency, with only a few (three per cent) resistant to change. Boards (83 per cent) and Leadership Teams (84 per cent) are the most likely to embrace the changes brought about by AI with high or moderate receptiveness. However, there is more work to be done amongst employees as a third (33 per cent) of organizations report that employees are either unwilling to adopt AI or outright resistant. Cisco AI Readiness Index The new Cisco AI Readiness Index is based on a double-blind survey of 8,161 private sector business and IT leaders across 30 markets, conducted by an independent third-party surveying respondents from companies with 500 or more employees. The Index assessed respondents’ AI readiness across six key pillars: strategy, infrastructure, data, talent, governance, and culture. Companies were examined on 49 different metrics across these six pillars to determine a readiness score for each, as well as an overall readiness score for the respondents’ organization. Each indicator was assigned an individual weightage based on its relative importance to achieving readiness for the applicable pillar. Based on their overall score, Cisco has identified four groups at different levels of organizational readiness – Pacesetters (fully prepared), Chasers (moderately prepared), Followers (limited preparedness), and Laggards (unprepared).

Currently, the company’s headquarters is located in San Jose, CA, USA. Cisco’s history began with a scandal. Bosack, while still employed at Stanford, developed the first router with Cisco’s co-founder Kirk Lougheed. However, it was a copy of Stanford’s \"Blue Box\" router. It ran a non-licensed copy of Stanford’s multi-protocol router software that was incorporated into the foundation of Cisco IOS. In 1986, Bosack and Lougheed were fired from Stanford. Still, in 1987, the university agreed to license Cisco router software and two computer boards. However, the conflict didn’t affect the company's future. Nowadays, Cisco provides a wide range of products and services for a variety of customers, including service providers, small and medium businesses, corporations, government agencies, utilities, and educational institutions. Even if you already knew that information, it’s unlikely you’ve heard about the Cisco Networking Academy. It was founded in October 1997. Currently, the Academy is located in more than 12,000 places worldwide. Students can study various areas of networking for the Internet online and offline. This way, the company finds employees to broaden its company and helps young people get the required skills to find a well-paid job. Cisco’s stocks are listed on NASDAQ under the #CSCO ticker. Institutional investors hold the largest part of the company’s shares - around 75%. However, it doesn’t prevent individual investors and traders from dealing with the company’s stocks. Despite the low value of the company's stocks, Cisco is quite stable. Also, the low stock price is positive for both investors and traders. Traders can benefit from the rise and fall of the price, while investors can invest in the company with minimum funds. The closing price’s all-time high of $80.06 was recorded on March 27, 2000.\n\n---\n\n[2023-11-16] 2023-11-16 00:00:00\n标题: Cisco Shares Tumble as Outlook Misses Estimates After a Pullback in Orders\n内容: Cisco Systems (CSCO) shares plummeted over 11% in early trading Thursday as the computer network equipment maker’s current quarter guidance missed estimates, and it cut its full-year outlook as customers pulled back on spending. Cisco said it anticipates second quarter fiscal 2024 revenue in the range of $12.6 billion to $12.8 billion, well short of forecasts. The company also slashed its 2024 estimates of earnings per share (EPS) to $3.87 to $3.93 and revenue to $53.8 billion to $55 billion. It had previously projected EPS of $4.01 to $4.08 and revenue at $57 billion to $58.2 billion. Cisco said it saw a slowdown of new product orders in the first quarter, adding that it believes “the primary reason is that customers are currently focused on installing and implementing products in their environments following exceptionally strong product delivery over the past three quarters.” The company explained that it anticipates that there are one to two quarters of shipped product orders “still waiting to be implemented by its customers.” Cisco executives indicated that while macroeconomic challenges remain, supply chain constraints have eased. They noted both shipment lead times and backlog have mostly returned to their normal levels. In the first quarter, the company reported EPS of $1.11 and sales of $14.67 billion. Both were better than expected. Shares of Cisco Systems sank to their lowest level since May and put them nearly even for the year. TradingView",

        "content": "TTEC Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTEC) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript November 9, 2023 Operator: Welcome to TTEC's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded at the request of TTEC. I would now like to turn the call over to Paul Miller, TTEC's Senior Vice President, Treasurer, and Investor Relations Officer. Thank you. Sir, you may begin. Paul Miller : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. TTEC is hosting this call to discuss its third quarter financial results for the period ended September 30, 2023. Participating on today's call are Ken Tuchman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TTEC; Shelly Swanback, Chief Executive Officer of TTEC Engage and President of TTEC; and Francois Bourret, Interim Chief Financial Officer of TTEC. Yesterday, TTEC issued a press release announcing its financial results. While this call will reflect items discussed within that document, for complete information about our financial performance, we also encourage you to read our third quarter 2023 quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Before we begin, I want to remind you that matters discussed on today's call may include forward-looking statements related to our operating performance, financial goals and business outlook, which are based on management's current beliefs and assumptions. Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to revise this information as a result of new developments that may occur. Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected and described today. For a more detailed description of our risk factors, please review our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K. A replay of this conference call will be available on our website under the Investor Relations section. I will now turn the call over to Ken. Story continues Kenneth Tuchman : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. This quarter, we continued to focus on delivering high-value CX outcomes for our clients and seamless technology-enabled experiences for their customers. In this current challenging environment, I am proud that our global team delivered on our Q3 forecast and that we have met or exceeded overall expectations each quarter year-to-date. Turning now to our third quarter consolidated results. Revenue was $603 million. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted EBITDA was $64 million, operating income was $47 million and EPS was $0.48. There is no question that businesses are operating in a state of unprecedented and accelerating change. The macroeconomic factors that we have been discussing for the last several quarters are unfortunately now playing out. Contributing factors include higher interest rates that are expected to last longer, ongoing inflation above target rates, labor strengths in multiple industries, looming student loan payments, inconsistent consumer spending habits, and geopolitical unrest. With all this uncertainty, it's no surprise that businesses and consumer confidence is beginning to fade and overall sentiment continues to decline. Every day, it's getting harder for businesses to predict and rely on their traditional indicators to plan for the future. While the economy may not technically be in a recession, many of our clients are now operating as though we are. Given all these factors, we're updating our outlook for Q4 and guidance for the full year. Clients are scrutinizing the dollars they spend. They're focusing their attention and resources on initiatives that are urgent, essential, and will have an immediate and predictable financial benefit on their business. The impact on us is mixed. For some of our clients, this mindset is delaying decision-making or driving last-minute unexpected changes in forecast as they prepare for future headwinds. Conversely, for other clients, these pressures are steering them towards options like offshoring, process improvements, and technology innovations, all areas where TTEC excels. While the current dynamics may be temporarily uncertain, we maintain our conviction that CX is a business imperative, a brand differentiator, and will be a strategic driver of growth and profitability for decades to come. Although the sector is currently somewhat challenged, I want to reiterate our confidence in the attractiveness of the market opportunity, our differentiated capabilities and our strategy to drive TTEC forward. We are navigating this environment thoughtfully, and we'll continue to balance our focus on innovation with operational and financial rigor. Shelly will share more details shortly. Now, on to a discussion around AI. Last quarter, we outlined our AI strategy across both TTEC Engage and TTEC Digital, and we're making good progress. Market interest in AI remains high. However, implementation has been primarily limited to pilots. Many clients see the potential benefits. However, they currently lack the technology infrastructure, data readiness, and confidence that these initiatives can scale in a cost-effective and reliable manner. The findings of our recent AI benchmark study reflect the current limited state of market and client readiness. For example, one, for businesses to unlock the full benefit of AI, they must move to the cloud. However, almost half the respondents to our study expressed concern about their technology platform readiness and only a small fraction are operating at a scale in the cloud. Number two, the ability to understand and act on insights from conversational intelligence is essential to achieve the right balance in automation and human interaction. However, close to 75% of the respondents cite issues around data quality and customer privacy as current barriers to their success. And three, while new generative AI-enabled tools are emerging daily to augment associate productivity, only a few of our study respondents have even begun the pilot capabilities like proactive knowledge management, AI-generated response, and real-time coaching. It is clear that the initial hype and early excitement around AI is moderating. As clients look beyond pilots, they're discovering that they need deep and practical CX expertise like ours to put these new AI-enabled capabilities to work. Through TTEC Digital, TTEC Engage, and our deep partnerships with the hyperscalers, we're uniquely positioned and ready to capture the opportunity as the market and technologies continue to evolve and mature. Now, let me briefly update you on several other key initiatives. We continue to expand our geographic footprint to provide clients with a variety of high-quality, lower-cost solutions. We've been operating on 5 continents for decades, and we continue to grow. Year-to-date, we've expanded to 8 new offshore locations with more on horizon. In addition, through TTEC Digital, we continue to broaden our global delivery capabilities, particularly in India, doubling the size of our Hyderabad engineering team since the start of the year. Our strategic relationships with the premier CX technology partners continues to grow stronger, stickier, and more valuable. With preferred status with all the CX hyperscalers, we're working together to pioneer new AI-based solutions, accelerate market adoption, and expand our global reach. For example, given our extensive public sector experience, we're working with one of our hyperscaler strategic partners to help them navigate the complexity of public sector operations. Our engineers are supporting them in the development of their comprehensive roadmap for FedRAMP certification. For another hyperscaler, we're working side-by-side to architect next-generation AI-enabled workforce optimization capabilities for their CCaaS platform. Before I turn it over to Shelly, I'd like to share a few closing comments. There is no doubt that every business, including ours, is operating in a rapidly changing and complex environment. However, it's important to emphasize that over the past 41 years, TTEC has successfully navigated challenging economic cycles and technological disruptions before. Because of our trusted relationships with clients, market reputation as an innovator and leader and the dedication of our employees across the globe, we've emerged stronger every time. As we move ahead in this climate, I'm confident in our leadership and go-forward strategy. Our focused approach will continue to enable us to deliver valuable CX outcomes for our clients, differentiated experiences for their customers, compelling career opportunities for our employees, and improved financial performance for our shareholders. And now, I'll hand it over to Shelly. Shelly Swanback: Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our performance year-to-date, but let me begin my comments by addressing the impact of the dynamic macroeconomic environment and our change in full-year guidance. This quarter, a few of our engaged clients made sudden changes to their forecast due to their business conditions. Those actions will unfortunately impact our fourth quarter and full-year results. And while Digital exceeded Q3 guidance, delayed client decisions will impact their Q4 revenue. Not surprisingly, market uncertainty was a theme in our recent client advisory meeting. While they couldn't speak to individual clients daily, hearing our voices together amplified several things. CX remains a priority. However, in this climate, clients are carefully focusing their investments on initiatives with an immediate financial payoff. Cost pressures are challenging clients to do things very differently. Clients will lean into partners like us who have the skills, tools, and experience to guide them as the landscape continues to evolve. They value our ability to provide a variety of nearshore and offshore locations, CX technology solutions and practical services that will rapidly impact their bottom line. Generative AI continues to generate interest. While clients are excited about the potential, they're seeking proven use cases before they move forward with full force. This is especially true in regulated and complex industries. And as Ken mentioned earlier, we're making good progress on our AI strategy that we outlined last quarter. We're actively partnering with clients in both TTEC Digital and TTEC Engage to better understand how to responsibly and affordably scale what we're learning from successful pilots. We currently have dozens of projects in flight. For example, this quarter, we collaborated with an auto OEM in Europe on a conversational AI effort. We captured and analyzed intents to define optimal routing strategies in real-time. Enabled across 15 languages, the initiatives delivered dramatic improvements, including 24/7 availability, a faster response time, a lower handle time, and over $1 million in projected cost savings annually. In healthcare, we're partnering with the payer to shorten their sales cycle by integrating generative AI into the pre-enrollment process. Our consulting team is lending data with a human-centered design approach to ensure that every interaction is handled with an optimal balance of empathy and convenience. We're also applying AI across our business internally. We're using LLMs and knowledge assist applications to improve the efficiency of our internal help desk, complex analytic models to evaluate new hire candidates, voice detect processing to speed up desktop administration, and AI for marketing segmentation and creative development. Using AI responsibly across our business is one of our highest priorities. Ultimately, we'll touch everything we do. I look forward to sharing additional progress on all of our AI initiatives in the quarters to come. Now on to business update for TTEC Digital. A business executive reviewing customer analytics on their laptop in a modern office. We exceeded our Q3 guidance, closing 14 new logos as we continue to help clients improve the quality of their customer experiences with CX technology. Revenue including product sales was up for the quarter 15%. Growth in our recurring managed services, which makes up 50% of our digital revenue, continues to be driven by a high percentage of client renewals as well as new logos, particularly in our Genesys practice. Elongated sales cycles impacted our professional services revenue this quarter and into next quarter. While some companies are delaying their technology modernization plans, many are faced with end-of-life platform decisions that require action. Encouragingly, we are starting to see several opportunities that were delayed moving through our pipeline. To that end, we expect solid Q4 bookings that have nearly 70 migration initiatives in our pipeline compared to 38 migrations completed so far this year. As we move forward, we will continue to leverage our differentiated position in TTEC Digital. We employ some of the most tenured expertise in CCaaS, CRM, and analytics across the globe. With several thousand specialized engineers, we've implemented more CX solutions than anyone. And with our growing offshore innovation center in Hyderabad, we're building a profitable and scalable mix of onshore and offshore talent. Moving on to Engage. This quarter, we continue to make progress on our strategic priorities, win new clients, and expand with existing clients. Third quarter revenue reflects continued solid demand in healthcare, financial services, and public sector. Revenue from these verticals grew 7%. However, as I mentioned earlier, some Engage client decisions negatively impacted the results and our outlook for the fourth quarter. Specifically, our fourth quarter seasonal business will not grow as expected given client response to the macro factors discussed earlier and an isolated situation with one financially challenged client. Additionally, a few clients in the telecom sector changed their forecast in response to reduced customer demand from lackluster mobile technology and product releases. From a margin perspective, it goes without saying that we're actively adjusting supply and demand for these client programs and continue to implement cost-related actions in response to the overall environment. We expect these efforts to have a more meaningful impact in 2024 and look forward to sharing more details with you on our Q4 call. Now, moving on to some highlights for the quarter. Engage closed 10 new logos across a variety of services and industry verticals, including healthcare and financial services, technology, and retail. More than half of these new logos will be delivered offshore. Additionally, more than half of our expansion with the existing clients will be delivered offshore as well. And we established our presence in Malaysia and Thailand with additional Asian language support. While offshore deal sizes are generally smaller, we're pleased that our expanded language capabilities and geographic presence are resonating with our clients. Our offshore pipeline is up more than 50% compared to last year. Now for some overall closing comments before I hand it over to Francois, we believe that the challenging macro conditions will persist through the end of this year and into early 2024. In both Digital and Engage, we're keenly focused on managing everything in our control to capitalize on market opportunities, while operating an agile platform and in a prudent approach to cost management. With our portfolio of clients, technology and talent, we're confident about our future. On behalf of our Board, our leadership team, and 65,000 employees across the globe, thank you for your continued support. Now, over to you, Francois. Francois Bourret : Thank you, Shelly, and good morning. I will start by addressing our third quarter financial results before sharing additional context into our updated fourth quarter and full-year 2023 financial outlook. In my discussion on the third quarter financial results, reference to revenue is on a GAAP basis, while EBITDA, operating income, and earnings per share are on a non-GAAP adjusted basis. A full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the tables attached to our earnings press release. TTEC's consolidated third quarter financial results are in line with our previously provided guidance. Our Digital segment exceeded expectations, while our Engage segment faced some softness around specific areas that will also impact our fourth quarter outlook. For our third quarter consolidated financial results, revenue was $603 million compared to $592 million in the prior year period, representing 0.8% growth on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $64 million or 10.6% of revenue compared to $68.5 million or 11.6% in the prior year. Operating income was $47 million or 7.8% of revenue compared to $50 million or 8.5% in the prior year. And EPS was $0.48 compared to $0.68 in the prior year. In the third quarter, foreign exchange movement over the prior year period positively impacted revenue by $6 million, and negatively impacted operating income by $1 million. The year-over-year decrease in operating and EBITDA margins was primarily a function of lower Engage revenue driven by sudden changes in client demand, creating temporary stranded costs. On the other hand, we continue to rationalize and optimize resources to maintain an agile cost structure. Turning to our third quarter segment performance. Digital financial performance was above our forecast for the quarter. Our Digital segment reported third quarter 2023 revenue of $133 million, an increase of 14.7% over the prior year period. Operating income was $19 million or 14.5% of revenue compared to $16 million or 13.6% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding the Cisco practice and one-time product sales, the Digital business grew 7% year-over-year in the third quarter. Our Digital core operating efficiencies contributed to the improved overall operating margin. The recurring managed services revenue grew 4% in the third quarter over the same period last year, and represents more than 50% of Digital's total revenue. If we exclude the Cisco decline for the same period, managed services increased by nearly 20%. In the third quarter, Cisco represented 29% of our recurring revenue, down from over 50% just a couple of years ago. One-time product sales in the quarter were associated with the acceleration of CX infrastructure investments and were a key contributor to this quarter growth, including $5 million brought forward from the fourth quarter. Our Engage segment reported third quarter 2023 revenue of $470 million, a decrease of 2.6% on a constant currency basis over the prior year. This financial performance was below our forecast shared for the third quarter. Representing 53% of Engage revenue, the healthcare, pub sec, and financial services verticals are growing organically by 7% in the third quarter of 2023, despite the lower demand than anticipated for seasonal work, modestly impacting the third quarter, but having a greater impact in the fourth quarter. It represents the primary reason for the Engage revenue shortfall relative to the previous midpoint of our guidance. In the third quarter, operating income was $28 million or 5.9% of revenue compared to $34 million or 7.2% in the prior year. Our Engage operating margin is primarily a function of the aforementioned factors impacting revenue and associated near-term costs. Margins also reflect the planned strategic investments that we continue to make to expand our offshore delivery footprint. I will now share other third quarter 2023 measures before discussing our outlook. Cash flow from operations in the third quarter was a negative $32 million compared to a positive $28 million in the prior year period. The more timely collection of receivables over last year was more than offset by timing of certain accounts payable, payroll, higher interest expense, and lower profitability. Year-to-date, our free cash flow increased by $4 million to $59 million over the prior year period, despite a $34 million increase in net interest expense over the prior 9-month period. Capital expenditures were $22 million or 3.6% of revenue for the third quarter 2023 compared to $29 million or 4.9% in the prior year period. The reduction is primarily a function of reduced facility related in renovations and IT equipment purchases on behalf of clients. As of September 30, 2023, cash was $152 million with $967 million of debt, of which $964 million represented borrowings under our $1.5 billion credit facility. Year-over-year, net debt increased by $29 million to $816 million, primarily related to capital distributions and acquisition-related payments, partially offset by the positive free cash flow. Our capital allocation remains focused on investments that support our strategic initiatives as well as the service of our debt and shareholder returns. TTEC paid a $0.52 per share or $24.7 million semiannual dividend on October 31, 2023 to shareholders of record as of October 16, 2023. Turning to our fourth quarter and full-year 2023 outlook. We have lowered the range of our full-year guidance based on our updated outlook for the fourth quarter. On a consolidated basis, we now expect full-year revenue to be in the range of $2.43 billion and $2.45 billion, relatively flat with the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin percentage to be in the range of 11.1% and 11.4% and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.11 to $2.27. The earlier tax estimate decreases to 24% and interest expenses remain unchanged. Please refer to the third quarter earnings press release for the updated guidance range. I will now provide additional context into our updated outlook at the segment level, primarily driven by client actions due to the uncertain environment. Digital's fourth quarter outlook reduced our full-year revenue guidance by $50 million, driven by the timing impact from the longer sales cycle and delayed bookings, especially for professional services. Based on quarter-to-date pipeline conversions, we anticipate solid Digital professional services bookings in the fourth quarter. In addition, excluding Cisco services and one-time product sales, our digital business is anticipated to grow 5% year-over-year per our fourth quarter outlook. Finally, the margin shortfall from lower revenue will be offset by greater execution and efficiencies attributable to our strong offshore footprint and cost rationalization aligning with our long-term strategy. Turning to Engage. The fourth quarter revenue outlook explains the $42 million reduction to our full-year revenue guidance, reflecting the level of uncertainty. 60% of our revenue change to our prior guidance is explained by the moderated level of seasonal reward in healthcare and public sector relative to our earlier growth expectation. The balance of the revenue reduction came from the telco vertical for the reasons shared by Shelly. From a margin standpoint, our guidance range reflects the isolated credit risk of the client mentioned by Shelly and a temporary supply and demand imbalance. As we rebalance staffing levels with demand, our operating costs will return to normalized levels by year-end. In addition, we have also accelerated other cost takeout initiatives in the fourth quarter that will primarily benefit margins in 2024. TTEC's overall pipeline for the next 6 months continues to be above $1 billion, which is well diversified across verticals, geographies, and CX service offerings. In closing, we're pleased with our year-to-date results. However, the rapidly changing macroeconomic uncertainties impacted a number of our clients, and in turn, put downward pressure on our financial outlook for the next months. As a result, and until the economic environment and visibility improves, we will continue to apply a conservative view, driven by the weakening consumer demand and higher for longer interest rates. Longer term, we continue to view the fundamentals of our business and the value proposition we provide as exceptionally durable. As we're pivoting to 2024, we remain keenly focused on our strategic priorities that will deliver profitable growth. We look forward to providing our full-year 2024 outlook when we announce our fourth quarter earnings results at the end of February. I will now turn the call back to Paul. Paul Miller : Thanks, Francois. As we open up the call, we ask that you limit your questions to one at a time. Operator, you may now open the line.

        "title": "Cisco Launches New Research, Highlighting Seismic Gap in Companies’ Preparedness for AI",
        "content": "Toronto, Nov. 14, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- News Summary: Ninety-six per cent of organizations in Canada reported that the urgency to deploy AI-powered technologies has increased in their company in the past six months. Considerable gaps exist across six key business pillars — strategy, infrastructure, data, governance, talent and culture — with only nine per cent of companies saying they are fully ready to integrate AI into their businesses. Companies are racing against time as 55 per cent said they have a maximum of one year to deploy their AI strategy or else it will have a negative impact on business. Toronto, Canada, Nov. 14, 2023 — Only nine per cent of Canadian organizations are fully prepared to deploy and leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered technologies, according to Cisco’s (NASDAQ: CSCO) inaugural AI Readiness Index released today. The Index, which surveyed over 8,000 global companies, was developed in response to the accelerating adoption of AI, a generational shift that is impacting almost every area of business and daily life. The report highlights companies’ preparedness to utilize and deploy AI, showcasing critical gaps across key business pillars and infrastructures that pose serious risks for the near future. The new research finds that while AI adoption has been slowly progressing for decades, the advancements in Generative AI, coupled with public availability in the past year, are driving greater attention to the challenges, changes and new possibilities posed by the technology. While 78 per cent of respondents believe AI will have a significant impact on their business operations, it also raises new issues around data privacy and security. The findings show that companies experience the most challenges when it comes to leveraging AI alongside their data. In fact, 83 per cent of respondents admit that this is due to data existing in silos across their organizations. However, there is also positive news. Data shows that companies in Canada are taking proactive measures to prepare for an AI-centric future. When it comes to building AI strategies, 95 per cent of organizations already have an AI strategy in place or in the process of developing one. In this category, over two thirds (68 per cent) of organizations are classified as either Pacesetters or Chasers (fully/partially prepared), with only six per cent falling into the category of Laggards (not prepared). This could be driven by the fact that most (96 per cent) respondents said the urgency to deploy AI technologies in their organization has increased in the past six months, with IT infrastructure and cybersecurity reported as the top priority areas for AI deployments. “Canada is experiencing a significant gap in its ability to adopt, deploy and capitalize on AI’s full potential. Business leaders must think beyond the here-and-now, looking ahead to their needs and building the infrastructure to match,” said Shannon Leininger, President of Cisco Canada. “Businesses need to holistically consider the elements of AI readiness so that we can not only take hold of all that AI has to offer, but do so responsibly.” Some of the most significant findings include: URGENCY: Businesses know they must act. Fifty-five per cent of respondents in Canada believe they have a maximum of one year to implement an AI strategy before their organization begins to incur significant negative business impact. STRATEGY: Step one is strategy, and organizations are well on their way. Sixty-eight per cent of organizations were benchmarked as either Pacesetters or Chasers, and only six per cent were found to be Laggards. Additionally, 93 per cent of organizations already have a defined AI strategy in place or are in the process of developing one, which is a positive sign, but shows there is more to do. INFRASTRUCTURE: Networks aren’t equipped to meet AI workloads. Ninety-five per cent of businesses globally are aware that AI will increase infrastructure workloads, but in Canada only 33 per cent of organizations consider their infrastructure highly scalable. Over a half (55 per cent) of companies have moderate or limited scalability when it comes to meeting new AI challenges within their current IT infrastructures. To accommodate AI’s increased power and computing demands, over two thirds (79 per cent) of companies will require further data center graphics processing units (GPUs) to support current and future AI workloads. DATA: Organizations cannot neglect the importance of ‘AI-ready’ data. While data serves as the backbone needed for AI operations, it is also the area where readiness is the weakest, with the greatest number of Laggards (18 per cent) compared to other pillars. Eighty-three per cent of Canadian respondents claim some degree of siloed or fragmented data in their organization. This poses a critical challenge as the complexity of integrating data that resides in various sources and making it available for AI implications can impact the ability to leverage the full potential of these applications. TALENT: The need for AI skills reveals a new-age digital divide. While 87 per cent of respondents said they are planning to invest in upskilling existing employees, 21 per cent alluded to an emerging AI divide, expressing doubt about the availability of enough talent to upskill. GOVERNANCE: AI policy adoption’s slow start. Only 29 per cent of respondents said they have highly comprehensive AI policies in place, an area that must be addressed as companies consider and govern all the factors that present a risk in eroding confidence and trust. These factors include data privacy and data sovereignty, and the understanding of, and compliance with, global regulations. Additionally, close attention must be paid to the concepts of bias, fairness, and transparency in both data and algorithms. CULTURE: Little preparation, but high motivation to make a priority. This pillar had the lowest number of Pacesetters (four per cent) compared to other categories. Twenty-seven per cent of companies have not established change management plans yet and of those that have, 68 per cent are still in-progress. But motivation is high. Three quarters (75 per cent) say their organization is embracing AI with a moderate to high level of urgency, with only a few (three per cent) resistant to change. Boards (83 per cent) and Leadership Teams (84 per cent) are the most likely to embrace the changes brought about by AI with high or moderate receptiveness. However, there is more work to be done amongst employees as a third (33 per cent) of organizations report that employees are either unwilling to adopt AI or outright resistant. Cisco AI Readiness Index The new Cisco AI Readiness Index is based on a double-blind survey of 8,161 private sector business and IT leaders across 30 markets, conducted by an independent third-party surveying respondents from companies with 500 or more employees. The Index assessed respondents’ AI readiness across six key pillars: strategy, infrastructure, data, talent, governance, and culture. Companies were examined on 49 different metrics across these six pillars to determine a readiness score for each, as well as an overall readiness score for the respondents’ organization. Each indicator was assigned an individual weightage based on its relative importance to achieving readiness for the applicable pillar. Based on their overall score, Cisco has identified four groups at different levels of organizational readiness – Pacesetters (fully prepared), Chasers (moderately prepared), Followers (limited preparedness), and Laggards (unprepared).

        "title": "CISCO SYS INC (#CSCO) Stock Price, Live Chart & Analysis | Trade #CSCO",
        "content": "Interesting facts about the #CSCO (CISCO SYS INC) Cisco was founded in 1984 by Stanford computer scientists Leonard Bosack and his wife Sandy Lerner. Currently, the company’s headquarters is located in San Jose, CA, USA. Cisco’s history began with a scandal. Bosack, while still employed at Stanford, developed the first router with Cisco’s co-founder Kirk Lougheed. However, it was a copy of Stanford’s \"Blue Box\" router. It ran a non-licensed copy of Stanford’s multi-protocol router software that was incorporated into the foundation of Cisco IOS. In 1986, Bosack and Lougheed were fired from Stanford. Still, in 1987, the university agreed to license Cisco router software and two computer boards. However, the conflict didn’t affect the company's future. Nowadays, Cisco provides a wide range of products and services for a variety of customers, including service providers, small and medium businesses, corporations, government agencies, utilities, and educational institutions. Even if you already knew that information, it’s unlikely you’ve heard about the Cisco Networking Academy. It was founded in October 1997. Currently, the Academy is located in more than 12,000 places worldwide. Students can study various areas of networking for the Internet online and offline. This way, the company finds employees to broaden its company and helps young people get the required skills to find a well-paid job. Cisco’s stocks are listed on NASDAQ under the #CSCO ticker. Institutional investors hold the largest part of the company’s shares - around 75%. However, it doesn’t prevent individual investors and traders from dealing with the company’s stocks. Despite the low value of the company's stocks, Cisco is quite stable. Also, the low stock price is positive for both investors and traders. Traders can benefit from the rise and fall of the price, while investors can invest in the company with minimum funds. The closing price’s all-time high of $80.06 was recorded on March 27, 2000."

        "content": "Cisco Systems (CSCO) shares plummeted over 11% in early trading Thursday as the computer network equipment maker’s current quarter guidance missed estimates, and it cut its full-year outlook as customers pulled back on spending. Cisco said it anticipates second quarter fiscal 2024 revenue in the range of $12.6 billion to $12.8 billion, well short of forecasts. The company also slashed its 2024 estimates of earnings per share (EPS) to $3.87 to $3.93 and revenue to $53.8 billion to $55 billion. It had previously projected EPS of $4.01 to $4.08 and revenue at $57 billion to $58.2 billion. Cisco said it saw a slowdown of new product orders in the first quarter, adding that it believes “the primary reason is that customers are currently focused on installing and implementing products in their environments following exceptionally strong product delivery over the past three quarters.” The company explained that it anticipates that there are one to two quarters of shipped product orders “still waiting to be implemented by its customers.” Cisco executives indicated that while macroeconomic challenges remain, supply chain constraints have eased. They noted both shipment lead times and backlog have mostly returned to their normal levels. In the first quarter, the company reported EPS of $1.11 and sales of $14.67 billion. Both were better than expected. Shares of Cisco Systems sank to their lowest level since May and put them nearly even for the year. TradingView"

This paradigm has resulted in missed opportunities to support sustainable rehabilitation and commitment to community safety. We can be leaders in reimagining and building toward a holistic vision of safety that brings people incarcerated and correctional staff together to produce the changes they want, need, and deserve—changes rooted in health, value, personal agency, connectedness, and trust. Dr. Nneka Jones Tapia, one of the first psychologists to lead an American jail, will draw upon her experiences as well as those of correctional officers, people incarcerated, and survivors of crime to help us challenge our current concept of safety. Alongside a few co-presenters from the Chicago Beyond National Advisory Council on Justice Initiatives, she will share best practices learned from leading initiatives with lived experience groups aimed at instilling holistic safety in large correctional institutions. Participants should leave confident enough to communicate what holistic safety is (and is not) and to push systems toward these new goalposts. Register for the Webinar Take Aways: During this webinar, participants will: Analyze different correctional systems to determine what factors are contributing to a lack of safety. Learn how to explain to system stakeholders how health, value, personal agency, connectedness, and trust all contribute to safety so as to guide policy changes that reduce systemic harms. Articulate why and how lived experience groups—like correctional officers, people incarcerated, and survivors of crime—must be engaged to make system change successful. Who Should Attend? Any employee of a state, federal, local, or tribal correctional jurisdiction. Presenters Dr. Nneka Jones Tapia Managing Director, Justice Initiatives, Chicago Beyond Dr. Nneka Jones Tapia is the managing director for Justice Initiatives at Chicago Beyond. She is an experienced psychologist who is passionate about mental wellness, criminal justice reform, and supporting young people who have experienced trauma. Since joining Chicago Beyond in 2018, Dr. Tapia collaborated to launch programs focused on positive family engagement for families who are justice-involved, holistic healing supports within Chicago Public Schools and peer-led healing supports for youth. She is the former warden of Cook County jail in Chicago, Illinois—one of the largest single site jails in the country. Under her leadership, Cook County jail implemented several bold strategies to promote wellness and to reduce recidivism, including the Mental Health Transition Center, a program that has helped hundreds of people who have been incarcerated to successfully rejoin their families and reenter communities.

Overview and Context The UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the US National Security Agency (NSA), US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are releasing this joint advisory to provide details of tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) associated with APT28’s exploitation of Cisco routers in 2021. We assess that APT28 is almost certainly the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) 85th special Service Centre (GTsSS) Military Intelligence Unit 26165. APT28 (also known as Fancy Bear, STRONTIUM, Pawn Storm, the Sednit Gang and Sofacy) is a highly skilled threat actor. Download the UK PDF version of this report: APT28 exploits known vulnerability to carry out reconnaissance and deploy malware on Cisco routers (PDF, 366.88 KB ) Download the US PDF version of this report: APT28 Exploits Known Vulnerability to Carry Out Reconnaissance and Deploy Malware on Cisco Routers (PDF, 366.25 KB ) Previous Activity The NCSC has previously attributed the following activity to APT28: Cyber attacks against the German parliament in 2015, including data theft and disrupting email accounts of German Members of Parliament (MPs) and the Vice Chancellor Attempted attack against the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in April 2018, to disrupt independent analysis of chemicals weaponized by the GRU in the UK For more information on APT28 activity, see the advisory Russian State-Sponsored and Criminal Cyber Threats to Critical Infrastructure and Russian GRU Conducting Global Brute Force Campaign to Compromise Enterprise and Cloud Environments. As of 2021, APT28 has been observed using commercially available code repositories, and post-exploit frameworks such as Empire. This included the use of PowerShell Empire, in addition to Python versions of Empire. Reconnaissance Use of SNMP Protocol to Access Routers In 2021, APT28 used infrastructure to masquerade Simple Network Management protocol (SNMP) access into Cisco routers worldwide. This included a small number based in Europe, US government institutions and approximately 250 Ukrainian victims. SNMP is designed to allow network administrators to monitor and configure network devices remotely, but it can also be misused to obtain sensitive network information and, if vulnerable, exploit devices to penetrate a network. A number of software tools can scan the entire network using SNMP, meaning that poor configuration such as using default or easy-to-guess community strings, can make a network susceptible to attacks. Weak SNMP community strings, including the default \"public,\" allowed APT28 to gain access to router information. APT28 sent additional SNMP commands to enumerate router interfaces. [T1078.001] The compromized routers were configured to accept SNMP v2 requests. SNMP v2 doesn’t support encryption and so all data, including community strings, is sent unencrypted. Exploitation of CVE-2017-6742 APT28 exploited the vulnerability CVE-2017-6742 (Cisco Bug ID: CSCve54313) [T1190]. This vulnerability was first announced by Cisco on 29 June 2017, and patched software was made available. Cisco's published advisory provided workarounds, such as limiting access to SNMP from trusted hosts only, or by disabling a number of SNMP Management Information bases (MIBs). Malware Deployment For some of the targeted devices, APT28 actors used an SNMP exploit to deploy malware, as detailed in the NCSC’s Jaguar Tooth Malware Analysis Report. This malware obtained further device information, which is exfiltrated over trivial file transfer protocol (TFTP), and enabled unauthenticated access via a backdoor. The actor obtained this device information by executing a number of Command Line Interface (CLI) commands via the malware. It includes discovery of other devices on the network by querying the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) table to obtain MAC addresses. [T1590] Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) Please refer to the accompanying Malware Analysis Report for indicators of compromise which may help to detect this activity. MITRE ATT&CK® This advisory has been compiled with respect to the MITRE ATT&CK® framework, a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. For detailed TTPs, see the Malware Analysis Report. Tactic ID Technique Procedure Initial Access T1190 Exploit Public-facing Application. APT28 exploited default/well-known community strings in SNMP as outlined in CVE-2017-6742 (Cisco Bug ID: CSCve54313). Initial Access T1078.001 Valid Accounts: Default Accounts. Actors accessed victim routers by using default community strings such as “public.” Reconnaissance T1590 Gather Victim Network Information Access was gained to perform reconnaissance on victim devices. Further detail of how this was achieved in available in the MITRE ATT&CK section of the Jaguar Tooth MAR. Conclusion APT28 has been known to access vulnerable routers by using default and weak SNMP community strings, and by exploiting CVE-2017-6742 (Cisco Bug ID: CSCve54313) as published by Cisco. TTPs in this advisory may still be used against vulnerable Cisco devices. Organizations are advised to follow the mitigation advice in this advisory to defend against this activity. Reporting UK organizations should report any suspected compromises to the NCSC. US organisations should contact CISA’s 24/7 Operations Centre at report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870. Mitigation Mitigation Patch devices as advised by Cisco. The NCSC also has general guidance on managing updates and keeping software up to date. Do not use SNMP if you are not required to configure or manage devices remotely to prevent unauthorized users from accessing your router. If you are required to manage routers remotely, establish allow and deny lists for SNMP messages to prevent unauthorized users from accessing your router. Do not allow unencrypted (i.e., plaintext) management protocols, such as SNMP v2 and Telnet. Where encrypted protocols aren’t possible, you should carry out any management activities from outside the organization through an encrypted virtual private network (VPN), where both ends are mutually authenticated. Enforce a strong password policy. Don’t reuse the same password for multiple devices. Each device should have a unique password. Where possible, avoid legacy password-based authentication and implement two-factor authentication based on public-private key. Disable legacy unencrypted protocols such as Telnet and SNMP v1 or v2c. Where possible, use modern encrypted protocols such as SSH and SNMP v3. Harden the encryption protocols based on current best security practice. The NCSC strongly advises owners and operators to retire and replace legacy devices that can’t be configured to use SNMP v3. Use logging tools to record commands executed on your network devices, such as TACACS+ and Syslog. Use these logs to immediately highlight suspicious events and keep a record of events to support an investigation if the device’s integrity is ever in question. See NCSC guidance on monitoring and logging. If you suspect your router has been compromised: Follow Cisco’s advice for verifying the Cisco IOS image. Revoke all keys associated with that router. When replacing the router configuration be sure to create new keys rather than pasting from the old configuration. Replace both the ROMMON and Cisco IOS image with an image that has been sourced directly from the Cisco website, in case third party and internal repositories have been compromised. NSA’s Network Infrastructure guide provides some best practices for SNMP. See also the Cisco IOS hardening guide and Cisco’s Jaguar Tooth blog.

        "title": "Instilling Holistic Safety: How We Can Reimagine Our Approach Toward Safety in Corrections",
        "content": "Correctional safety has historically pitted both correctional staff against people incarcerated and security procedures against the resources and opportunities needed to help people to thrive. This paradigm has resulted in missed opportunities to support sustainable rehabilitation and commitment to community safety. We can be leaders in reimagining and building toward a holistic vision of safety that brings people incarcerated and correctional staff together to produce the changes they want, need, and deserve—changes rooted in health, value, personal agency, connectedness, and trust. Dr. Nneka Jones Tapia, one of the first psychologists to lead an American jail, will draw upon her experiences as well as those of correctional officers, people incarcerated, and survivors of crime to help us challenge our current concept of safety. Alongside a few co-presenters from the Chicago Beyond National Advisory Council on Justice Initiatives, she will share best practices learned from leading initiatives with lived experience groups aimed at instilling holistic safety in large correctional institutions. Participants should leave confident enough to communicate what holistic safety is (and is not) and to push systems toward these new goalposts. Register for the Webinar Take Aways: During this webinar, participants will: Analyze different correctional systems to determine what factors are contributing to a lack of safety. Learn how to explain to system stakeholders how health, value, personal agency, connectedness, and trust all contribute to safety so as to guide policy changes that reduce systemic harms. Articulate why and how lived experience groups—like correctional officers, people incarcerated, and survivors of crime—must be engaged to make system change successful. Who Should Attend? Any employee of a state, federal, local, or tribal correctional jurisdiction. Presenters Dr. Nneka Jones Tapia Managing Director, Justice Initiatives, Chicago Beyond Dr. Nneka Jones Tapia is the managing director for Justice Initiatives at Chicago Beyond. She is an experienced psychologist who is passionate about mental wellness, criminal justice reform, and supporting young people who have experienced trauma. Since joining Chicago Beyond in 2018, Dr. Tapia collaborated to launch programs focused on positive family engagement for families who are justice-involved, holistic healing supports within Chicago Public Schools and peer-led healing supports for youth. She is the former warden of Cook County jail in Chicago, Illinois—one of the largest single site jails in the country. Under her leadership, Cook County jail implemented several bold strategies to promote wellness and to reduce recidivism, including the Mental Health Transition Center, a program that has helped hundreds of people who have been incarcerated to successfully rejoin their families and reenter communities.

        "content": "APT28 accesses poorly maintained Cisco routers and deploys malware on unpatched devices using CVE-2017-6742. Overview and Context The UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the US National Security Agency (NSA), US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are releasing this joint advisory to provide details of tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) associated with APT28’s exploitation of Cisco routers in 2021. We assess that APT28 is almost certainly the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) 85th special Service Centre (GTsSS) Military Intelligence Unit 26165. APT28 (also known as Fancy Bear, STRONTIUM, Pawn Storm, the Sednit Gang and Sofacy) is a highly skilled threat actor. Download the UK PDF version of this report: APT28 exploits known vulnerability to carry out reconnaissance and deploy malware on Cisco routers (PDF, 366.88 KB ) Download the US PDF version of this report: APT28 Exploits Known Vulnerability to Carry Out Reconnaissance and Deploy Malware on Cisco Routers (PDF, 366.25 KB ) Previous Activity The NCSC has previously attributed the following activity to APT28: Cyber attacks against the German parliament in 2015, including data theft and disrupting email accounts of German Members of Parliament (MPs) and the Vice Chancellor Attempted attack against the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in April 2018, to disrupt independent analysis of chemicals weaponized by the GRU in the UK For more information on APT28 activity, see the advisory Russian State-Sponsored and Criminal Cyber Threats to Critical Infrastructure and Russian GRU Conducting Global Brute Force Campaign to Compromise Enterprise and Cloud Environments. As of 2021, APT28 has been observed using commercially available code repositories, and post-exploit frameworks such as Empire. This included the use of PowerShell Empire, in addition to Python versions of Empire. Reconnaissance Use of SNMP Protocol to Access Routers In 2021, APT28 used infrastructure to masquerade Simple Network Management protocol (SNMP) access into Cisco routers worldwide. This included a small number based in Europe, US government institutions and approximately 250 Ukrainian victims. SNMP is designed to allow network administrators to monitor and configure network devices remotely, but it can also be misused to obtain sensitive network information and, if vulnerable, exploit devices to penetrate a network. A number of software tools can scan the entire network using SNMP, meaning that poor configuration such as using default or easy-to-guess community strings, can make a network susceptible to attacks. Weak SNMP community strings, including the default \"public,\" allowed APT28 to gain access to router information. APT28 sent additional SNMP commands to enumerate router interfaces. [T1078.001] The compromized routers were configured to accept SNMP v2 requests. SNMP v2 doesn’t support encryption and so all data, including community strings, is sent unencrypted. Exploitation of CVE-2017-6742 APT28 exploited the vulnerability CVE-2017-6742 (Cisco Bug ID: CSCve54313) [T1190]. This vulnerability was first announced by Cisco on 29 June 2017, and patched software was made available. Cisco's published advisory provided workarounds, such as limiting access to SNMP from trusted hosts only, or by disabling a number of SNMP Management Information bases (MIBs). Malware Deployment For some of the targeted devices, APT28 actors used an SNMP exploit to deploy malware, as detailed in the NCSC’s Jaguar Tooth Malware Analysis Report. This malware obtained further device information, which is exfiltrated over trivial file transfer protocol (TFTP), and enabled unauthenticated access via a backdoor. The actor obtained this device information by executing a number of Command Line Interface (CLI) commands via the malware. It includes discovery of other devices on the network by querying the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) table to obtain MAC addresses. [T1590] Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) Please refer to the accompanying Malware Analysis Report for indicators of compromise which may help to detect this activity. MITRE ATT&CK® This advisory has been compiled with respect to the MITRE ATT&CK® framework, a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. For detailed TTPs, see the Malware Analysis Report. Tactic ID Technique Procedure Initial Access T1190 Exploit Public-facing Application. APT28 exploited default/well-known community strings in SNMP as outlined in CVE-2017-6742 (Cisco Bug ID: CSCve54313). Initial Access T1078.001 Valid Accounts: Default Accounts. Actors accessed victim routers by using default community strings such as “public.” Reconnaissance T1590 Gather Victim Network Information Access was gained to perform reconnaissance on victim devices. Further detail of how this was achieved in available in the MITRE ATT&CK section of the Jaguar Tooth MAR. Conclusion APT28 has been known to access vulnerable routers by using default and weak SNMP community strings, and by exploiting CVE-2017-6742 (Cisco Bug ID: CSCve54313) as published by Cisco. TTPs in this advisory may still be used against vulnerable Cisco devices. Organizations are advised to follow the mitigation advice in this advisory to defend against this activity. Reporting UK organizations should report any suspected compromises to the NCSC. US organisations should contact CISA’s 24/7 Operations Centre at report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870. Mitigation Mitigation Patch devices as advised by Cisco. The NCSC also has general guidance on managing updates and keeping software up to date. Do not use SNMP if you are not required to configure or manage devices remotely to prevent unauthorized users from accessing your router. If you are required to manage routers remotely, establish allow and deny lists for SNMP messages to prevent unauthorized users from accessing your router. Do not allow unencrypted (i.e., plaintext) management protocols, such as SNMP v2 and Telnet. Where encrypted protocols aren’t possible, you should carry out any management activities from outside the organization through an encrypted virtual private network (VPN), where both ends are mutually authenticated. Enforce a strong password policy. Don’t reuse the same password for multiple devices. Each device should have a unique password. Where possible, avoid legacy password-based authentication and implement two-factor authentication based on public-private key. Disable legacy unencrypted protocols such as Telnet and SNMP v1 or v2c. Where possible, use modern encrypted protocols such as SSH and SNMP v3. Harden the encryption protocols based on current best security practice. The NCSC strongly advises owners and operators to retire and replace legacy devices that can’t be configured to use SNMP v3. Use logging tools to record commands executed on your network devices, such as TACACS+ and Syslog. Use these logs to immediately highlight suspicious events and keep a record of events to support an investigation if the device’s integrity is ever in question.

The expectations are high as analysts anticipate the company to announce earnings of $0.99 per share for the quarter. This guidance falls within eBay’s previous forecast range of $0.96-1.01 EPS for Q2. Investors and stakeholders eagerly await the upcoming conference call, where they will have the opportunity to gain insights into eBay’s financial performance and future prospects. The conference call promises to shed light on various aspects of the company’s operations and strategies, providing valuable information for investors to make informed decisions. However, as anticipation builds around eBay’s earnings report, recent news regarding insider trading has caught some attention. SVP Cornelius Boone sold 5,500 shares of eBay stock on May 12th at an average price of $44.67 per share, resulting in a total value of $245,685. Following this transaction, Boone now retains ownership of 44,982 shares valued at $2,009,345.94. This sale was disclosed in a document filed with the Securities & Exchange Commission. Moreover, another insider involvement was highlighted when CAO Rebecca Spencer sold 2,193 shares on June 12th at an average price of $45.85 per share-amounting to a total transaction value of $100,549.05. Spencer currently holds 924 shares in eBay with an approximate value of $42,365.40. These transactions raise questions among market observers concerning potential implications for eBay’s financial health and future outlooks. Insider trading activities can sometimes indicate insiders’ lack of confidence or signal potential concerns about the company’s prospects. It is worth mentioning that individuals participating in these transactions represent only a fraction (0.21%) of eBay’s overall stock ownership by insiders and management. Interestingly enough, eBay recently announced a quarterly dividend payment that was made on June 16th. Shareholders of record as of June 1st received a $0.25 dividend per share. This amounts to an annualized dividend of $1.00 and a yield of 2.08%. The ex-dividend date for this payment was May 31st. It remains to be seen how these recent developments, including the insider trading activities and dividend payout, will influence investors’ sentiment towards eBay’s stock. The earnings report scheduled for July 26th will provide a clearer picture of the company’s financial performance, shedding light on its ability to navigate the ever-changing e-commerce landscape. Investors and stakeholders are advised to closely monitor the conference call and analyze eBay’s quarterly results in detail. This data will play a significant role in determining the future trajectory of eBay’s stock price and overall market perception. As we approach the end of July, all eyes are on eBay as it prepares to reveal its second-quarter earnings, offering insight into not only its financial well-being but also its competitive position within the e-commerce industry. eBay’s Robust Financial Performance Shines Amidst Market Volatility eBay Reports Strong Financial Performance Amidst Market Volatility Publication Date: July 19, 2023 eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), a leading e-commerce company, recently announced its impressive earnings results for the quarter ended April 26th. The company showcased its resilience as it met analysts’ consensus estimates and reported a solid revenue figure of $2.51 billion. Buoyed by these positive numbers, eBay remains an attractive choice for investors seeking stability in the market. During the quarter, eBay exhibited strong financial health, with a net margin of 6.51% and a return on equity of 35.65%. These figures reflect the company’s astute management and ability to generate consistent profits while navigating industry challenges. With an average expectation from analysts for the current fiscal year to post $3 EPS and $4 EPS for the following year, eBay affirms its standing as an investor-friendly enterprise. On Wednesday, eBay’s stock opened at $48.03, marking a promising start amidst market volatility. The company’s shares have seen significant fluctuations over the past year—ranging from a low of $35.92 to a high of $52.23—indicating both risks and opportunities for prospective shareholders. eBay maintains a sound financial structure with a current ratio of 2.68 and a quick ratio of 2.68, ensuring its ability to meet short-term obligations while staying nimble in an ever-evolving landscape. Furthermore, its commitment to responsible financial decision-making is evident with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.43—showing prudent leverage management. Demonstrating long-term stability, eBay showcases promising indicators such as a 50-day moving average of $44.81 and a 200-day moving average of $45.16. These figures affirm cautious yet steady growth patterns within the organization. Notably, several renowned research firms have expressed their views on eBay, solidifying its position as an investment-worthy entity. While Wolfe Research lowered their price target to $51.00, Mizuho increased their target price to $48.00 and maintained a “neutral” rating, highlighting the company’s ability to attract diverse assessments. TheStreet upgraded eBay from a “c” rating to a “b-” rating, indicating positive industry sentiment.

Analyst Price Forecast Suggests 2.04% Upside As of July 5, 2023, the average one-year price target for EBay is 49.94. The forecasts range from a low of 34.34 to a high of $63.00. The average price target represents an increase of 2.04% from its latest reported closing price of 48.94. See our leaderboard of companies with the largest price target upside. The projected annual revenue for EBay is 9,846MM, an increase of 0.24%. The projected annual non-GAAP EPS is 4.33. EBay Declares $0.25 Dividend On April 26, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share ($1.00 annualized). Shareholders of record as of June 1, 2023 received the payment on June 16, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.25 per share. At the current share price of $48.94 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 2.04%. Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 1.72%, the lowest has been 0.89%, and the highest has been 3.83%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.66 (n=236). The current dividend yield is 0.49 standard deviations above the historical average. Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.84. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5. The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is 0.56%, demonstrating that it has increased its dividend over time. What is the Fund Sentiment? There are 1821 funds or institutions reporting positions in EBay. This is a decrease of 10 owner(s) or 0.55% in the last quarter.

We delivered another solid quarter in Q2, exceeding expectations across all key metrics, while investing in a disciplined manner to support our long-term objectives. Before I jump into the details around our second quarter results, I'd like to discuss the evolution of our strategy. Three years ago, I articulated our ambition of becoming the best global marketplace to buy and sell, through a tech-led reimagination at eBay. This would help us realize the enormous untapped potential of this company and put us firmly on a path to sustainable long-term growth. Since then, we renewed our focus on products, where we are uniquely positioned to offer meaningful choices and value for our customers. We've accelerated innovation, so we've adapted the changing needs of buyers and developed world class shopping experiences in our focus categories. And we've changed our marketing strategy to support these experiences, pivoting to a full funnel approach aimed at attracting and retaining enthusiast buyers. These accomplishments make it a logical time to embark on the next phase of our journey. The foundational work of our tech-led reimagination will continue, including our prioritization of non-new in season products, expansion of focus categories in ads and payments initiatives. And now, we're raising the bar for innovation and have set our sights on an even more ambitious vision, which is reinventing the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts only at eBay. We will achieve this vision in the coming years by focusing on three key pillars: relevant experiences, scalable solutions and magical innovations. Let's start with our first pillar, relevant experiences. This means we are solving the specific and ever-changing needs of our customers across all shopping occasions. Through our focus category strategy, we've proven that when we build relevant experiences, we can dramatically improve customer satisfaction, which translates into faster GMV growth. While we continue to understand customer needs and innovate at the category level, we will leverage the new tools, capabilities and technologies we have developed over the last few years to enhance more elements of the site-wide experience. This includes developing a more relevant, consistent experience for the next-generation of online shoppers through a comprehensive overhaul of our user experience and design rolled out in phases over the course of 2023 and beyond. This evolution will result in simpler, more personalized browsing experiences that will inspire people to sell, shop and connect with their community on eBay. This initiative is a cross-collaborative effort between design, product, core AI, search, engineering and other key stakeholders to ensure our modernized shopping experience as powered by intelligent computing at scale. Enabled by Artificial Intelligence, we will fine-tune the breadth of inventory and other aspects of the shopping journey to cater to the varying needs of new buyers, infrequent shoppers and eBay enthusiasts. We believe these innovations will increase our ability to bend cohort curves, drive higher lifetime values and ultimately grow enthusiasts and average spend per buyer. We began rolling out these changes to consumers in recent months. Starting with testing a more modern and intuitive View Item page, which is the most visited page on eBay. The updated page offers a streamlined appearance, larger and higher resolution images and an optimized information hierarchy. Early test indicated measurable uplift in GMV versus our existing design. Over the next few quarters, you will see a continued evolution of the look, feel and experience of our marketplace, including updates to View Item, our header, homepage, search results and other landing pages. Alongside this work, we are investing in new capabilities for search where relevant is also critical. We are investing in technologies like deep learning and visual similarity to improve ranking and retrieval, reducing queries with low and no results to surface more of our amazing inventory for customers. Now let's turn to our second pillar, scalable solutions. Combined with improving relevance, our scale is a powerful asset. As we discussed at our Investor Day last year, eBay has five categories that each generate more than $10 billion annually in GMV, making up more than 80% of volume on our marketplace, in aggregate. Our global footprint across the 190 markets and density of supply and demand across major trade quarters are tremendous advantages in cross border trade. And our proprietary data assets are powered by tens of billions of cumulative transactions, and commercially relevant product information and images accumulated over our nearly 28-year history. Our scale enabled us to launch a proprietary managed payments solution capable of processing more than $70 billion in annualized volume in less than two years. It also allowed us to build our nearly $1.3 billion advertising business, driven by Promoted Listings which help our sellers drive greater velocity and price realization for their inventory. Ads and payments have dramatically enhanced our financial architecture, but now we are widening the scope of scalable solutions on eBay to develop a broader suite of value-added services. Our payments infrastructure makes it possible for us to launch new financial services like FX conversion, alternative payment options and seller financing partnerships informed by transactions on eBay. We're also investing an improved in-house risk modeling to alleviate transactional friction for sellers and buyers on eBay, which has led to measurable uplift in conversion and hundreds of millions of dollars of incremental GMV during the first half of 2023 alone. Our scale and cross-border capabilities allowed us to launch the eBay International Shipping program earlier this year. This program simplifies paperwork, lowers cost for buyers, streamlines returns and enables sellers to tap into our global demand. While this program is still ramping up in the U.S., we are seeing positive proof points and the number of listings migrated, increased exportability of new listings, as well as conversion delivery times and operational costs in line with our expectations. The cross category nature of eBay makes our investments in individual focus categories more scalable to other areas. This is because technology and capabilities that are developed for one category can be adapted quickly and seamlessly to others. For instance, eBay's Authenticity Guarantee program has enabled us to rapidly transform trust across new categories and countries from watches to sneakers, handbags, jewelry and trading cards. Now, it's faster and more cost-efficient to launch authentication for a new category like we did this quarter with streetwear. We believe only eBay is in a position to bring hyper relevant experiences like these to customers at scale across this breadth of categories. Lastly, our third pillar is magical innovations. The foundational work we've accomplished over the past three years has set us up for a new phase of innovation. Our teams are focused on thinking bigger and moving faster as we've got game-changing features and functionality for customers to keep eBay at the forefront of e-commerce. Our improved tech velocity has allowed us to launch and rapidly iterate on exciting features like Live Commerce. Other examples include the ability to instantly buy and sell trading cards in the eBay vault and our improved computer vision capabilities that streamline buying and selling on eBay. Over the next few quarters and years, we expect advancements in artificial intelligence, including generative AI, impact nearly every aspect of our organization, driving meaningful efficiency and productivity improvements. More importantly, they enable truly compelling customer-facing experiences that I am confident our customers will love, such as the magical listing experience I'm excited to discuss with you shortly. You will continue to hear us talk about the progress of our Evolve strategy and how we're delivering on the three pillars of relevant experiences, scalable solutions and magical innovations. This work is all in service of our plan to reinvent the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts only at eBay. As I've mentioned, these efforts are already underway and we have begun delivering these innovative features and functionalities to eBay customers. Now let me turn to the second quarter. We delivered better than expected results across the board in Q2 despite continued macro uncertainty. Gross merchandise volume was over $18.2 billion, while revenue grew 5% to $2.54 billion and outpaced GMV growth by roughly 6 points. And we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.03, up 5%. Our improving growth trends continue to be led by our focus categories, which grew roughly 7 points faster than the remainder of our marketplace during Q2. This outperformance continues to be led by motors, parts and accessories, or P&A, where GMV grew mid single digits year-over-year for the second straight quarter, which we believe is in line with market rates of growth for this segment of e-commerce. We also extended our focus category coverage through new launches and category expansions during the quarter. In early June, we launched Authenticity Guarantee for streetwear in the U.S. and are now authenticating new and pre-owned streetwear items from 20 trusted brands including KITH, Off-White, Palace and Supreme. In July, we expanded eligible streetwear to mass appeal brands like Adidas, Jordan and Nike. And later this year, we'll expand coverage to luxury brands, including Gucci, Prada and Louis Vuitton. This marks our entry into authenticated apparel, a category that has strong overlap with our passionate community of sneaker enthusiasts, adding another layer of trust when they shop. In April, we launched the Certified by Brand program, which we also expect to facilitate more e-commerce in the luxury space. There are already more than 20 brands participating in this program, offering new and certified pre-owned inventory across the watch, jewelry and handbag categories. Listings from this program will show a direct from brand or brand authorized seller badge, bringing enhanced level of trust to these listings similar to visual trust signals for Authenticity Guarantee. Brands benefit from eBay's scale demand, gain access to consumer and pricing insights, while being able to maintain control of the brand equity and image online. eBay shoppers will benefit from these brands' unique inventory and enhanced trust, as these products will include certifications and/or warranties from the brands themselves. Our expertise in fashion is further extended by our recently closed acquisition of Certilogo, a provider of AI-powered authentication for apparel. Certilogo empowers brands and designers to manage the lifecycle of their garments, protect their customers from counterfeits and encourages recommerce via QR codes that serve as digital product passports. While we are just beginning to explore the synergies between our companies, Certilogo already works with a number of leading global fashion brands and we are incredibly excited to leverage this technology to accelerate the circular economy. Next, I'd like to discuss the groundbreaking work our team is doing with artificial intelligence. In particular, I'm excited to announce that this quarter, we're ramping-up a new feature we've been calling magical listing, which will make it significantly easier for sellers to list their inventory. One of the biggest challenges operating a listings based marketplace is the burden on sellers to fill in descriptions and item aspects for their products In May, we launched the first version of our magical listing experience, which dramatically reduces this friction for our sellers via AI generated item descriptions. We integrated Azure's OpenAI API into our core listing flow. And now sellers can choose to have detailed product information instantly populated by generative AI based on the product's title, category and any item aspects that have been implied. During the quarter, we ramped this data feature to more than 50% of iOS and Android users in the U.S., and expect to reach a 100% in the coming weeks. Early signals have been extremely positive. Approximately 30% of users have tried to feature at least once and we've observed acceptance rates of over 90% for AI generated descriptions, including those with edits [Phonetic]. Customer satisfaction is over 80% thus far, which is among the highest CSAT for any new feature launch in recent memory. Sellers have told us that this feature will unlock more of the unique inventory in their closets. And on average, we are seeing description lenghts double when GenAI is used. But we're just getting started. The next generation of our magical listings will leverage our improved image recognition capabilities to provide photos with the option of a more seamless camera-based listing. Sellers can utilize their smartphone camera or existing photos to start a listing. And based on our visual understanding of the product, the eBay app can pre-populate the title, category, description and item specifics wherever possible. We have been testing this tool with our employees for several weeks, and we are incredibly excited to launch in public beta in the coming months. The advent of generative AI aspired an explosion of creativity at eBay among our product and engineering teams, who have conceptualized new and innovative shopping experiences that can be rapidly deployed onto the site. Two compelling examples that launched in July are the shop by upgrade and engine code look up features that went from concept to production in the eBay Motors app in adjusted a few weeks. Shop by upgrade uses generative AI to help customers discover the most relevant fitment enabled upgrade options for their vehicles, which are personalized based on the specific users preferences. Engine code look up offers specific P&A products available on eBay that can address the root cause of hard to decipher error codes, aiding them in identifying and fixing the source of the problem. I'm thrilled to see how quickly our teams are moving with this technology at their disposal and look forward to more of these experiences launching in pilots in the months ahead. Turning next to our advertising business, which continues to build impressive momentum. We reached a major milestone in Q2 as advertising revenue reached 2% penetration of GMV. Total ads grew 35% while first-party ad revenue grew roughly 50 points faster than GMV. Over 2.1 million sellers adopted a single ad product in Q2, while we reached more than 800 million live Promoted Listings. Promoted Listings standard, our CPA product, once again the largest contributor to growth in Q2 driven by attribution enhancements, continued optimization and ad rate improvements. At the end of March, we adjusted our attribution methodology for CPA adds, expanding the definition of what constitutes a qualified sale. This change referred to as a halo attribution in the industry, enable us to more efficiently optimize our ads as we capture a more complete picture of the downstream sales driven by Promoted Listings. While sellers maintain the full flexibility to adjust their bidding behavior after this change, halo attribution had a net positive impact on our ad business in Q2. During the quarter, we also introduced a new way to rank ads on search, which leverages our in-house AI capabilities to optimize CPA placements for both conversion and ad rates. Additionally, we improved our precision in calculating trending and suggested ad rates and made it easier to adopt dynamic bidding, both contributed to a modest lift in Q2 ad rate. Our emerging Promoted Listings products also scaled nicely in Q2, growing more than 30% quarter-over-quarter. Promoted Listings Advanced, our CPC product was the largest contributor. Advanced recently exited beta into general release as we have simplified the process of creating and managing campaigns, increase the visibility of CPC ads on eBay and demonstrated healthy return on ad spend levels to sellers. During Q2, we introduced suggested campaigns for Advanced, which provide a one click activation experience by offering customized keywords, bid and add group structures for B2C sellers across five major markets. These campaigns we pushed out to sellers on a monthly cadence and can drive further adoption of CPC ads. Now let's discuss the impact we're having on the communities we serve. Last quarter, we published our annual Impact Report, which recognizes the progress we've made toward environmental and social goals. As a pioneer of e-commerce, we are committed to helping sellers earn extra cash selling pre-loved items and helping buyers find items and value while promoting a healthier planet and economy. I am proud that we continue to make important strides toward our own climate goals while weaving sustainability throughout our company culture and philanthropic efforts. Additionally, we will soon publish our first ever UK Social Impact Report, which takes a closer look at the programs we're delivering for hundreds of underserved entrepreneurs, social enterprises and charities in the UK. This includes programs like eBay for Change, which support social entrepreneurs, increase jobs in marginalized and vulnerable communities. Another program with considerable impact is eBay for Charity, which raised more than $38 million during the quarter. And I'm excited to announce that Engage for Good, a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the practice of cause marketing recognized eBay for Charity as a 2023 Charity Checkout Champion. In closing, I would like to thank our incredible employees for another strong quarter of execution and for continuing to bring our strategic vision to life. I have never been more confident that we are on the right path to unlocking our enormous untapped potential and reinventing the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts only at eBay. Our focus on relevant experiences, scalable solutions and magical innovations will greatly benefit our loyal community of sellers and buyers in the quarters and years ahead as well as better cater to the needs of the next generation of online shoppers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you. Steve Priest Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer at eBay Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with highlights from the second quarter on Slide 10 of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll review our key financial and operating metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the third quarter and offer some additional commentary on the remainder of the year before we begin Q&A. As usual, my comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons on an organic FX-neutral basis unless I note otherwise. We delivered solid results in Q2 as our GMV, revenue and EPS exceeded expectations and came in at or above the high-end of our guidance ranges despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. Gross merchandise volume was down 1% to $18.2 billion, an improvement from down 3% in Q1. Revenue was up 5% to $2.54 billion, which outpaced volume by 6 points, driven by accelerating growth within our advertising business. Non-GAAP operating margin is 26.9%, down roughly 1.7 points year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of eBay International Shipping ramp in recent M&A. We delivered $1.03 of non-GAAP earnings per share, up 5% year-over-year. And we generated $492 million of free cash flow by returning $383 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Let's take a closer look at the key drivers of our financial performance during the second quarter. Gross merchandise volume was down 1% to $18.2 billion, an improvement from down 3% in Q1 due to continued momentum within focused categories and a notable acceleration in cross-border trade. Foreign exchange represented a 1 point headwind to reported GMV growth in Q2. GMV growth in our focus categories accelerated modestly and outpaced the remainder of our marketplace by roughly 7 points during the second quarter. We launched a new focus category in U.S. Streetwear, extended trading cards to Canada and broadened our inventory coverage in sneakers, handbags and jewelry, which drove a sequential increase in GMV coverage. P&A was once again the largest contributor to GMV growth among focus categories, growing in the mid single digits year-over-year, in line with estimated market growth in this segment of e-commerce. eBay Refurbished, maintained healthy double-digit growth in Q2 and was the second largest contributor to focus category outperformance as consumers continue to turn to eBay for value in the current economic climate. Next, looking at our business on a geographic basis. U.S. GMV was down 4% organically in Q2, as domestic buyers continue to favor imports due to diminishing headwinds within global supply chains that benefited cross-border trade. International GMS grew 1% on an FX-neutral basis, accelerating by roughly 2 points sequentially. Although e-commerce growth remains weaker outside of the U.S. amidst heightened macro challenges, international GMV benefited from a sequential acceleration in volume from cross border trade. Moving to active buyers, 132 million active buyers shopped on eBay during the trailing 12 months ending in June, down 1 million quarter-over-quarter. Excluding M&A and buyers from our Turkey business, where we ceased operations in July of last year, we had 131 million active buyers, roughly flat versus Q1. As we lap the Turkey closure this month, this factor will no longer be a headwind to reported active buyers next quarter. The continued stabilization of our buyer account was driven by the fourth straight quarter of positive year-over-year growth in new and reactivated buyers, which was again led by double-digit growth in buyers from P&A. In isolation, new buyers grew year-over-year for the second straight quarter, while gross buyer churn has steadily improved throughout 2023. Enthusiast buyers are stable at 16 million in Q2, with net migration patterns improved slightly quarter-over-quarter. Spend per enthusiast grew modestly year-over-year averaging roughly $3,000 annually. Turning to revenue, we generated net revenue of $2.54 billion in Q2, up 5%, an acceleration of roughly 3 points versus Q1. Total FX-neutral revenue growth, inclusive of M&A, was 6%, while currency was a 1 point headwind to reported growth. Our take rate was 13.9% in Q2, more than 30 basis points sequentially, and up nearly 90 basis points year-over-year. Advertising revenue was the largest driver of our take rate growth, both sequentially and year-over-year. EBay International Shipping and recent M&A in aggregate contributed nearly 10 basis points to our Q2 take rate sequentially. Our new payment services contributed roughly 2 basis points. Foreign exchange represented a sequential headwind of approximately 10 basis points to take away in the second quarter. Our advertising business accelerated notably in Q2 as total ad revenue grew 35%, a 12-point acceleration versus Q1. First-party ads grew 49%, roughly 50 points faster than volume. The GMV is also widened by 17 points sequentially. However, roughly 4 points of this gap were related to a one-time accounting adjustment of deferred revenue on cost per click ad space, following the halo attribution change Jamie discussed earlier. The deferral release pulled forward approximately $9 million of ad revenue into Q2, which we will lap in Q3. The outstanding results within our ads business were driven by continued optimization of Promoted Listings standard, and expansion of our emerging products like advanced and external Promoted Listings. As we lap one-time factors like ad portfolio expansion, recent product optimization wins, halo attribution and the one-time accounting change, we do expect the GMV delta to narrow in current levels. However, we still anticipate advertising revenue will outpace GMV for the foreseeable future. Moving to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.9% in Q2, down 1.7 points year-over-year. Roughly 1.5 points of this delta is due to the combination of eBay International Shipping and recent M&A, while FX also represented a modest year-over-year headwind. Gross margin was down roughly 80 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to a 1 point headwind from the progressive ramp of eBay International Shipping which was partly offset by an increase in take rate driven by ads and other monetization efficiencies. Further, marketing as a percentage of revenue was down nearly 80 basis points year-over-year in Q2 as our continued investment in full funnel marketing initiatives was offset by leverage on monetization efficiencies and lower spend on coupons and incentives. Product development rose by 1.1 points as we continue to invest in product and engineering talent to accelerate innovation across the platform. Our G&A expense rose by roughly 60 basis points, driven by M&A and higher employee spend. We generated non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.03 in Q2, up 5% year-over-year, benefiting from a 4% net reduction in share count from our repurchases. We delivered GAAP earnings per share of $0.32, where the delta primarily driven by unrealized losses on our equity investment portfolio. Turning to our balance sheet and capital allocation. We generated free cash flow of $492 million in Q2, up 6%. Our balance sheet position remains robust, and we ended the quarter with cash and non-equity investments of $5.3 billion and gross debt of $7.7 billion. We repurchased roughly $250 million in shares at an average price of approximately $44 during Q2 and have roughly $2.3 billion remaining under our current buyback authorization. We paid a quarterly cash dividend of $133 million in June or $0.25 per share. Our investment portfolio is detailed on Slide 20 of our earnings presentation. Our major equity investments and warrants were valued at over $3.4 billion at the end of Q2. This represents a decrease of approximately $200 million sequentially, driven primarily by the recent share price decline in Adevinta. Moving on to our outlook. For the third quarter, we forecast GMV between $17.6 billion and $18 billion, representing organic FX-neutral growth between negative 4% and negative 1% year-over-year. We expect revenue between $2.46 billion and $2.52 billion, representing organic FX-neutral growth between 2% and 4% year-over-year. We anticipate non-GAAP operating margin to fall between 25.8% to 26.5%, and we forecast non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.96 and $1.01, representing EPS growth between negative 4% and positive 1% year-over-year. We are currently planning our business around the assumption of total FX-neutral GMV growth between negative 2% and negative 1% year-over-year for the full year of 2023. We expect revenue to outpace GMV by approximately 4.5 points for the full year on a spot basis. Although FX neutral revenue growth should continue to outpace GMV by mid single digits during the second half, at current FX rates, our year-over-year growth in spot revenue and GMV would converge in Q4 as we lapped significant FX hedging gains in the prior year period. We are now planning for full year 2023 non-GAAP operating margins between 27% and 27.4%. Our margin assumptions contemplate a year-over-year headwind of roughly 1 point from the combination of recent M&A and the eBay International Shipping program. However, we do expect the operating margin impact from eIS to abide [Phonetic] by the fourth quarter. Our margin assumptions imply more than $100 million of opex savings from our structural cost program in 2023, which will be redeployed into strategic objectives. If foreign currencies hold at current rates, FX would represent a tailwind of roughly 0.5 point to GMV growth for the full year in 2023. However, FX would represent roughly 0.5 points headwind to operating margin for 20223 with approximately 2 points of impact during Q4 alone due to hedging gains in the prior year period. FX also represents more than a 2-point headwind to non-GAAP EPS for the full year. Lastly, for the full year, we expect to generate just under $2 billion in free cash flow. Due to California State disaster tax relief, the majority of our cash tax payments scheduled for 2023 have been deferred and will be paid in October. As such, we expect the bulk of our remaining 2023 free cash flow to be recognized in Q3. We estimate our non-GAAP tax rate will remain unchanged at 16.5% throughout the rest of 2023. Our capital expenditures for the full year are still estimated to be between 4% to 6% of revenue. In closing, Q2 was another strong quarter for eBay as we delivered against our quarterly financial commitments and made significant progress on our long-term strategic objectives. Focus categories expanded in coverage positively influence growth for the marketplace overall. Our advertising business is driving robust growth at scale as first-party ads meaningfully accelerating relative to GMV. We continue to invest in products and full funnel marketing initiatives in a disciplined manner laying the foundation for sustainable growth. And we generated $492 million of free cash flow, returned $383 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends and have returned roughly 130% of free cash flow to shareholders over the last 18 months. I continue to be inspired by the accelerating pace of innovation at eBay as we reinvent the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts. With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions.\n\n---\n\n[2023-07-27] 2023-07-27 00:00:00\n标题: eBay Japan - Crunchbase Company Profile & Funding\n内容: Headquarters Location IPO Status Website CB Rank (Company) Total number of organizations similar to the given organization Descriptive keyword for an Organization (e.g. SaaS, Android, Cloud Computing, Medical Device) Where the organization is headquartered (e.g. San Francisco Bay Area, Silicon Valley) This is the parent Organization of the sub-organization Date the Organization was founded Operating Status of Organization e.g. Active, Closed Alternate or previous names for the organization The legal name of the organization Whether an Organization is for profit or non-profit",

        "title": "eBay’s Highly Anticipated Q2 Earnings Report: Insider Trading and Dividend Payout Raise Concerns",
        "content": "eBay, the popular online marketplace, is set to release its quarterly earnings data on July 26th, 2023. The expectations are high as analysts anticipate the company to announce earnings of $0.99 per share for the quarter. This guidance falls within eBay’s previous forecast range of $0.96-1.01 EPS for Q2. Investors and stakeholders eagerly await the upcoming conference call, where they will have the opportunity to gain insights into eBay’s financial performance and future prospects. The conference call promises to shed light on various aspects of the company’s operations and strategies, providing valuable information for investors to make informed decisions. However, as anticipation builds around eBay’s earnings report, recent news regarding insider trading has caught some attention. SVP Cornelius Boone sold 5,500 shares of eBay stock on May 12th at an average price of $44.67 per share, resulting in a total value of $245,685. Following this transaction, Boone now retains ownership of 44,982 shares valued at $2,009,345.94. This sale was disclosed in a document filed with the Securities & Exchange Commission. Moreover, another insider involvement was highlighted when CAO Rebecca Spencer sold 2,193 shares on June 12th at an average price of $45.85 per share-amounting to a total transaction value of $100,549.05. Spencer currently holds 924 shares in eBay with an approximate value of $42,365.40. These transactions raise questions among market observers concerning potential implications for eBay’s financial health and future outlooks. Insider trading activities can sometimes indicate insiders’ lack of confidence or signal potential concerns about the company’s prospects. It is worth mentioning that individuals participating in these transactions represent only a fraction (0.21%) of eBay’s overall stock ownership by insiders and management. Interestingly enough, eBay recently announced a quarterly dividend payment that was made on June 16th. Shareholders of record as of June 1st received a $0.25 dividend per share. This amounts to an annualized dividend of $1.00 and a yield of 2.08%. The ex-dividend date for this payment was May 31st. It remains to be seen how these recent developments, including the insider trading activities and dividend payout, will influence investors’ sentiment towards eBay’s stock. The earnings report scheduled for July 26th will provide a clearer picture of the company’s financial performance, shedding light on its ability to navigate the ever-changing e-commerce landscape. Investors and stakeholders are advised to closely monitor the conference call and analyze eBay’s quarterly results in detail. This data will play a significant role in determining the future trajectory of eBay’s stock price and overall market perception. As we approach the end of July, all eyes are on eBay as it prepares to reveal its second-quarter earnings, offering insight into not only its financial well-being but also its competitive position within the e-commerce industry. eBay’s Robust Financial Performance Shines Amidst Market Volatility eBay Reports Strong Financial Performance Amidst Market Volatility Publication Date: July 19, 2023 eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), a leading e-commerce company, recently announced its impressive earnings results for the quarter ended April 26th. The company showcased its resilience as it met analysts’ consensus estimates and reported a solid revenue figure of $2.51 billion. Buoyed by these positive numbers, eBay remains an attractive choice for investors seeking stability in the market. During the quarter, eBay exhibited strong financial health, with a net margin of 6.51% and a return on equity of 35.65%. These figures reflect the company’s astute management and ability to generate consistent profits while navigating industry challenges. With an average expectation from analysts for the current fiscal year to post $3 EPS and $4 EPS for the following year, eBay affirms its standing as an investor-friendly enterprise. On Wednesday, eBay’s stock opened at $48.03, marking a promising start amidst market volatility. The company’s shares have seen significant fluctuations over the past year—ranging from a low of $35.92 to a high of $52.23—indicating both risks and opportunities for prospective shareholders. eBay maintains a sound financial structure with a current ratio of 2.68 and a quick ratio of 2.68, ensuring its ability to meet short-term obligations while staying nimble in an ever-evolving landscape. Furthermore, its commitment to responsible financial decision-making is evident with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.43—showing prudent leverage management. Demonstrating long-term stability, eBay showcases promising indicators such as a 50-day moving average of $44.81 and a 200-day moving average of $45.16. These figures affirm cautious yet steady growth patterns within the organization. Notably, several renowned research firms have expressed their views on eBay, solidifying its position as an investment-worthy entity. While Wolfe Research lowered their price target to $51.00, Mizuho increased their target price to $48.00 and maintained a “neutral” rating, highlighting the company’s ability to attract diverse assessments. TheStreet upgraded eBay from a “c” rating to a “b-” rating, indicating positive industry sentiment. Moreover, StockNews.com recently upgraded eBay’s stock from a “hold” rating to a “buy” rating, further reinforcing the company’s growing appeal for potential investors. Wells Fargo & Company also expressed optimism by lifting their price objective on eBay shares to $46.00. It is worth noting that various factors come into play when assessing market confidence in eBay’s stock performance. With Bloomberg reporting an average rating of “Hold” and an average target price of $49.23 for eBay shares, investor perceptions encapsulate both caution and optimism—an indicator of continued market interest. In conclusion, amidst market volatility and uncertainty, eBay has demonstrated strength in its recent earnings report with impressive financial figures that align with analysts’ expectations. The company continues to embody stability and resilience within the e-commerce industry. As it maintains sound financial health and generates consistent profits while capturing diverse ratings from research firms, eBay emerges as an intriguing opportunity for investors seeking a foothold in the ever-changing marketplace.

        "content": "Fintel reports that on July 24, 2023, Credit Suisse maintained coverage of EBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) with a Outperform recommendation. Analyst Price Forecast Suggests 2.04% Upside As of July 5, 2023, the average one-year price target for EBay is 49.94. The forecasts range from a low of 34.34 to a high of $63.00. The average price target represents an increase of 2.04% from its latest reported closing price of 48.94. See our leaderboard of companies with the largest price target upside. The projected annual revenue for EBay is 9,846MM, an increase of 0.24%. The projected annual non-GAAP EPS is 4.33. EBay Declares $0.25 Dividend On April 26, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share ($1.00 annualized). Shareholders of record as of June 1, 2023 received the payment on June 16, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.25 per share. At the current share price of $48.94 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 2.04%. Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 1.72%, the lowest has been 0.89%, and the highest has been 3.83%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.66 (n=236). The current dividend yield is 0.49 standard deviations above the historical average. Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.84. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5. The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is 0.56%, demonstrating that it has increased its dividend over time. What is the Fund Sentiment? There are 1821 funds or institutions reporting positions in EBay. This is a decrease of 10 owner(s) or 0.55% in the last quarter.

With his expertise, he has offered invaluable insights into various stocks, including eBay. In the case of eBay, Colantuoni maintains a Hold rating but has revised the price target from $47 to $50. This indicates his suggestion to hold onto eBay stock while anticipating its price to reach $50. However, it’s crucial to acknowledge that this information is derived from available sources and may not be current or entirely accurate. To obtain the most up-to-date and reliable information, it is advisable to refer to official financial reports and statements from reputable sources. eBay Stock Performance and Financial Outlook: July 25, 2023 On July 25, 2023, eBay (EBAY) had a rather uneventful day on the stock market.

The company has shown positive earnings growth in the past year, with a growth rate of 31.92%. However, the earnings growth for this year has slowed down to 2.08%.

Additionally, the company recorded sales of $2.5 billion during this period. Overall, the stock performance of eBay Inc on July 25, 2023, was influenced by the median price target set by analysts, which indicated a potential increase in the stock’s value.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Jamie. Jamie Iannone President & Chief Executive Officer at eBay Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. We delivered another solid quarter in Q2, exceeding expectations across all key metrics, while investing in a disciplined manner to support our long-term objectives. Before I jump into the details around our second quarter results, I'd like to discuss the evolution of our strategy. Three years ago, I articulated our ambition of becoming the best global marketplace to buy and sell, through a tech-led reimagination at eBay. This would help us realize the enormous untapped potential of this company and put us firmly on a path to sustainable long-term growth. Since then, we renewed our focus on products, where we are uniquely positioned to offer meaningful choices and value for our customers. We've accelerated innovation, so we've adapted the changing needs of buyers and developed world class shopping experiences in our focus categories. And we've changed our marketing strategy to support these experiences, pivoting to a full funnel approach aimed at attracting and retaining enthusiast buyers. These accomplishments make it a logical time to embark on the next phase of our journey. The foundational work of our tech-led reimagination will continue, including our prioritization of non-new in season products, expansion of focus categories in ads and payments initiatives. And now, we're raising the bar for innovation and have set our sights on an even more ambitious vision, which is reinventing the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts only at eBay. We will achieve this vision in the coming years by focusing on three key pillars: relevant experiences, scalable solutions and magical innovations. Let's start with our first pillar, relevant experiences. This means we are solving the specific and ever-changing needs of our customers across all shopping occasions. Through our focus category strategy, we've proven that when we build relevant experiences, we can dramatically improve customer satisfaction, which translates into faster GMV growth. While we continue to understand customer needs and innovate at the category level, we will leverage the new tools, capabilities and technologies we have developed over the last few years to enhance more elements of the site-wide experience. This includes developing a more relevant, consistent experience for the next-generation of online shoppers through a comprehensive overhaul of our user experience and design rolled out in phases over the course of 2023 and beyond. This evolution will result in simpler, more personalized browsing experiences that will inspire people to sell, shop and connect with their community on eBay. This initiative is a cross-collaborative effort between design, product, core AI, search, engineering and other key stakeholders to ensure our modernized shopping experience as powered by intelligent computing at scale. Enabled by Artificial Intelligence, we will fine-tune the breadth of inventory and other aspects of the shopping journey to cater to the varying needs of new buyers, infrequent shoppers and eBay enthusiasts. We believe these innovations will increase our ability to bend cohort curves, drive higher lifetime values and ultimately grow enthusiasts and average spend per buyer. We began rolling out these changes to consumers in recent months. Starting with testing a more modern and intuitive View Item page, which is the most visited page on eBay. The updated page offers a streamlined appearance, larger and higher resolution images and an optimized information hierarchy. Early test indicated measurable uplift in GMV versus our existing design. Over the next few quarters, you will see a continued evolution of the look, feel and experience of our marketplace, including updates to View Item, our header, homepage, search results and other landing pages. Alongside this work, we are investing in new capabilities for search where relevant is also critical. We are investing in technologies like deep learning and visual similarity to improve ranking and retrieval, reducing queries with low and no results to surface more of our amazing inventory for customers. Now let's turn to our second pillar, scalable solutions. Combined with improving relevance, our scale is a powerful asset. As we discussed at our Investor Day last year, eBay has five categories that each generate more than $10 billion annually in GMV, making up more than 80% of volume on our marketplace, in aggregate. Our global footprint across the 190 markets and density of supply and demand across major trade quarters are tremendous advantages in cross border trade. And our proprietary data assets are powered by tens of billions of cumulative transactions, and commercially relevant product information and images accumulated over our nearly 28-year history. Our scale enabled us to launch a proprietary managed payments solution capable of processing more than $70 billion in annualized volume in less than two years. It also allowed us to build our nearly $1.3 billion advertising business, driven by Promoted Listings which help our sellers drive greater velocity and price realization for their inventory. Ads and payments have dramatically enhanced our financial architecture, but now we are widening the scope of scalable solutions on eBay to develop a broader suite of value-added services. Our payments infrastructure makes it possible for us to launch new financial services like FX conversion, alternative payment options and seller financing partnerships informed by transactions on eBay. We're also investing an improved in-house risk modeling to alleviate transactional friction for sellers and buyers on eBay, which has led to measurable uplift in conversion and hundreds of millions of dollars of incremental GMV during the first half of 2023 alone. Our scale and cross-border capabilities allowed us to launch the eBay International Shipping program earlier this year. This program simplifies paperwork, lowers cost for buyers, streamlines returns and enables sellers to tap into our global demand. While this program is still ramping up in the U.S., we are seeing positive proof points and the number of listings migrated, increased exportability of new listings, as well as conversion delivery times and operational costs in line with our expectations. The cross category nature of eBay makes our investments in individual focus categories more scalable to other areas. This is because technology and capabilities that are developed for one category can be adapted quickly and seamlessly to others. For instance, eBay's Authenticity Guarantee program has enabled us to rapidly transform trust across new categories and countries from watches to sneakers, handbags, jewelry and trading cards. Now, it's faster and more cost-efficient to launch authentication for a new category like we did this quarter with streetwear. We believe only eBay is in a position to bring hyper relevant experiences like these to customers at scale across this breadth of categories. Lastly, our third pillar is magical innovations. The foundational work we've accomplished over the past three years has set us up for a new phase of innovation. Our teams are focused on thinking bigger and moving faster as we've got game-changing features and functionality for customers to keep eBay at the forefront of e-commerce. Our improved tech velocity has allowed us to launch and rapidly iterate on exciting features like Live Commerce. Other examples include the ability to instantly buy and sell trading cards in the eBay vault and our improved computer vision capabilities that streamline buying and selling on eBay. Over the next few quarters and years, we expect advancements in artificial intelligence, including generative AI, impact nearly every aspect of our organization, driving meaningful efficiency and productivity improvements. More importantly, they enable truly compelling customer-facing experiences that I am confident our customers will love, such as the magical listing experience I'm excited to discuss with you shortly. You will continue to hear us talk about the progress of our Evolve strategy and how we're delivering on the three pillars of relevant experiences, scalable solutions and magical innovations. This work is all in service of our plan to reinvent the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts only at eBay. As I've mentioned, these efforts are already underway and we have begun delivering these innovative features and functionalities to eBay customers. Now let me turn to the second quarter. We delivered better than expected results across the board in Q2 despite continued macro uncertainty. Gross merchandise volume was over $18.2 billion, while revenue grew 5% to $2.54 billion and outpaced GMV growth by roughly 6 points. And we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.03, up 5%. Our improving growth trends continue to be led by our focus categories, which grew roughly 7 points faster than the remainder of our marketplace during Q2. This outperformance continues to be led by motors, parts and accessories, or P&A, where GMV grew mid single digits year-over-year for the second straight quarter, which we believe is in line with market rates of growth for this segment of e-commerce. We also extended our focus category coverage through new launches and category expansions during the quarter. In early June, we launched Authenticity Guarantee for streetwear in the U.S. and are now authenticating new and pre-owned streetwear items from 20 trusted brands including KITH, Off-White, Palace and Supreme. In July, we expanded eligible streetwear to mass appeal brands like Adidas, Jordan and Nike. And later this year, we'll expand coverage to luxury brands, including Gucci, Prada and Louis Vuitton. This marks our entry into authenticated apparel, a category that has strong overlap with our passionate community of sneaker enthusiasts, adding another layer of trust when they shop. In April, we launched the Certified by Brand program, which we also expect to facilitate more e-commerce in the luxury space. There are already more than 20 brands participating in this program, offering new and certified pre-owned inventory across the watch, jewelry and handbag categories. Listings from this program will show a direct from brand or brand authorized seller badge, bringing enhanced level of trust to these listings similar to visual trust signals for Authenticity Guarantee. Brands benefit from eBay's scale demand, gain access to consumer and pricing insights, while being able to maintain control of the brand equity and image online. eBay shoppers will benefit from these brands' unique inventory and enhanced trust, as these products will include certifications and/or warranties from the brands themselves. Our expertise in fashion is further extended by our recently closed acquisition of Certilogo, a provider of AI-powered authentication for apparel. Certilogo empowers brands and designers to manage the lifecycle of their garments, protect their customers from counterfeits and encourages recommerce via QR codes that serve as digital product passports. While we are just beginning to explore the synergies between our companies, Certilogo already works with a number of leading global fashion brands and we are incredibly excited to leverage this technology to accelerate the circular economy. Next, I'd like to discuss the groundbreaking work our team is doing with artificial intelligence. In particular, I'm excited to announce that this quarter, we're ramping-up a new feature we've been calling magical listing, which will make it significantly easier for sellers to list their inventory. One of the biggest challenges operating a listings based marketplace is the burden on sellers to fill in descriptions and item aspects for their products In May, we launched the first version of our magical listing experience, which dramatically reduces this friction for our sellers via AI generated item descriptions. We integrated Azure's OpenAI API into our core listing flow. And now sellers can choose to have detailed product information instantly populated by generative AI based on the product's title, category and any item aspects that have been implied. During the quarter, we ramped this data feature to more than 50% of iOS and Android users in the U.S., and expect to reach a 100% in the coming weeks. Early signals have been extremely positive. Approximately 30% of users have tried to feature at least once and we've observed acceptance rates of over 90% for AI generated descriptions, including those with edits [Phonetic]. Customer satisfaction is over 80% thus far, which is among the highest CSAT for any new feature launch in recent memory. Sellers have told us that this feature will unlock more of the unique inventory in their closets. And on average, we are seeing description lenghts double when GenAI is used. But we're just getting started. The next generation of our magical listings will leverage our improved image recognition capabilities to provide photos with the option of a more seamless camera-based listing. Sellers can utilize their smartphone camera or existing photos to start a listing. And based on our visual understanding of the product, the eBay app can pre-populate the title, category, description and item specifics wherever possible. We have been testing this tool with our employees for several weeks, and we are incredibly excited to launch in public beta in the coming months. The advent of generative AI aspired an explosion of creativity at eBay among our product and engineering teams, who have conceptualized new and innovative shopping experiences that can be rapidly deployed onto the site. Two compelling examples that launched in July are the shop by upgrade and engine code look up features that went from concept to production in the eBay Motors app in adjusted a few weeks. Shop by upgrade uses generative AI to help customers discover the most relevant fitment enabled upgrade options for their vehicles, which are personalized based on the specific users preferences. Engine code look up offers specific P&A products available on eBay that can address the root cause of hard to decipher error codes, aiding them in identifying and fixing the source of the problem. I'm thrilled to see how quickly our teams are moving with this technology at their disposal and look forward to more of these experiences launching in pilots in the months ahead. Turning next to our advertising business, which continues to build impressive momentum. We reached a major milestone in Q2 as advertising revenue reached 2% penetration of GMV. Total ads grew 35% while first-party ad revenue grew roughly 50 points faster than GMV. Over 2.1 million sellers adopted a single ad product in Q2, while we reached more than 800 million live Promoted Listings. Promoted Listings standard, our CPA product, once again the largest contributor to growth in Q2 driven by attribution enhancements, continued optimization and ad rate improvements. At the end of March, we adjusted our attribution methodology for CPA adds, expanding the definition of what constitutes a qualified sale. This change referred to as a halo attribution in the industry, enable us to more efficiently optimize our ads as we capture a more complete picture of the downstream sales driven by Promoted Listings. While sellers maintain the full flexibility to adjust their bidding behavior after this change, halo attribution had a net positive impact on our ad business in Q2. During the quarter, we also introduced a new way to rank ads on search, which leverages our in-house AI capabilities to optimize CPA placements for both conversion and ad rates. Additionally, we improved our precision in calculating trending and suggested ad rates and made it easier to adopt dynamic bidding, both contributed to a modest lift in Q2 ad rate. Our emerging Promoted Listings products also scaled nicely in Q2, growing more than 30% quarter-over-quarter. Promoted Listings Advanced, our CPC product was the largest contributor. Advanced recently exited beta into general release as we have simplified the process of creating and managing campaigns, increase the visibility of CPC ads on eBay and demonstrated healthy return on ad spend levels to sellers. During Q2, we introduced suggested campaigns for Advanced, which provide a one click activation experience by offering customized keywords, bid and add group structures for B2C sellers across five major markets. These campaigns we pushed out to sellers on a monthly cadence and can drive further adoption of CPC ads. Now let's discuss the impact we're having on the communities we serve. Last quarter, we published our annual Impact Report, which recognizes the progress we've made toward environmental and social goals. As a pioneer of e-commerce, we are committed to helping sellers earn extra cash selling pre-loved items and helping buyers find items and value while promoting a healthier planet and economy. I am proud that we continue to make important strides toward our own climate goals while weaving sustainability throughout our company culture and philanthropic efforts. Additionally, we will soon publish our first ever UK Social Impact Report, which takes a closer look at the programs we're delivering for hundreds of underserved entrepreneurs, social enterprises and charities in the UK. This includes programs like eBay for Change, which support social entrepreneurs, increase jobs in marginalized and vulnerable communities. Another program with considerable impact is eBay for Charity, which raised more than $38 million during the quarter. And I'm excited to announce that Engage for Good, a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the practice of cause marketing recognized eBay for Charity as a 2023 Charity Checkout Champion. In closing, I would like to thank our incredible employees for another strong quarter of execution and for continuing to bring our strategic vision to life. I have never been more confident that we are on the right path to unlocking our enormous untapped potential and reinventing the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts only at eBay. Our focus on relevant experiences, scalable solutions and magical innovations will greatly benefit our loyal community of sellers and buyers in the quarters and years ahead as well as better cater to the needs of the next generation of online shoppers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you. Steve Priest Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer at eBay Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with highlights from the second quarter on Slide 10 of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll review our key financial and operating metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the third quarter and offer some additional commentary on the remainder of the year before we begin Q&A. As usual, my comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons on an organic FX-neutral basis unless I note otherwise. We delivered solid results in Q2 as our GMV, revenue and EPS exceeded expectations and came in at or above the high-end of our guidance ranges despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. Gross merchandise volume was down 1% to $18.2 billion, an improvement from down 3% in Q1. Revenue was up 5% to $2.54 billion, which outpaced volume by 6 points, driven by accelerating growth within our advertising business. Non-GAAP operating margin is 26.9%, down roughly 1.7 points year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of eBay International Shipping ramp in recent M&A. We delivered $1.03 of non-GAAP earnings per share, up 5% year-over-year. And we generated $492 million of free cash flow by returning $383 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Let's take a closer look at the key drivers of our financial performance during the second quarter. Gross merchandise volume was down 1% to $18.2 billion, an improvement from down 3% in Q1 due to continued momentum within focused categories and a notable acceleration in cross-border trade. Foreign exchange represented a 1 point headwind to reported GMV growth in Q2. GMV growth in our focus categories accelerated modestly and outpaced the remainder of our marketplace by roughly 7 points during the second quarter. We launched a new focus category in U.S. Streetwear, extended trading cards to Canada and broadened our inventory coverage in sneakers, handbags and jewelry, which drove a sequential increase in GMV coverage. P&A was once again the largest contributor to GMV growth among focus categories, growing in the mid single digits year-over-year, in line with estimated market growth in this segment of e-commerce. eBay Refurbished, maintained healthy double-digit growth in Q2 and was the second largest contributor to focus category outperformance as consumers continue to turn to eBay for value in the current economic climate. Next, looking at our business on a geographic basis. U.S. GMV was down 4% organically in Q2, as domestic buyers continue to favor imports due to diminishing headwinds within global supply chains that benefited cross-border trade. International GMS grew 1% on an FX-neutral basis, accelerating by roughly 2 points sequentially. Although e-commerce growth remains weaker outside of the U.S. amidst heightened macro challenges, international GMV benefited from a sequential acceleration in volume from cross border trade. Moving to active buyers, 132 million active buyers shopped on eBay during the trailing 12 months ending in June, down 1 million quarter-over-quarter. Excluding M&A and buyers from our Turkey business, where we ceased operations in July of last year, we had 131 million active buyers, roughly flat versus Q1. As we lap the Turkey closure this month, this factor will no longer be a headwind to reported active buyers next quarter. The continued stabilization of our buyer account was driven by the fourth straight quarter of positive year-over-year growth in new and reactivated buyers, which was again led by double-digit growth in buyers from P&A. In isolation, new buyers grew year-over-year for the second straight quarter, while gross buyer churn has steadily improved throughout 2023. Enthusiast buyers are stable at 16 million in Q2, with net migration patterns improved slightly quarter-over-quarter. Spend per enthusiast grew modestly year-over-year averaging roughly $3,000 annually. Turning to revenue, we generated net revenue of $2.54 billion in Q2, up 5%, an acceleration of roughly 3 points versus Q1. Total FX-neutral revenue growth, inclusive of M&A, was 6%, while currency was a 1 point headwind to reported growth. Our take rate was 13.9% in Q2, more than 30 basis points sequentially, and up nearly 90 basis points year-over-year. Advertising revenue was the largest driver of our take rate growth, both sequentially and year-over-year. EBay International Shipping and recent M&A in aggregate contributed nearly 10 basis points to our Q2 take rate sequentially. Our new payment services contributed roughly 2 basis points. Foreign exchange represented a sequential headwind of approximately 10 basis points to take away in the second quarter. Our advertising business accelerated notably in Q2 as total ad revenue grew 35%, a 12-point acceleration versus Q1. First-party ads grew 49%, roughly 50 points faster than volume. The GMV is also widened by 17 points sequentially. However, roughly 4 points of this gap were related to a one-time accounting adjustment of deferred revenue on cost per click ad space, following the halo attribution change Jamie discussed earlier. The deferral release pulled forward approximately $9 million of ad revenue into Q2, which we will lap in Q3. The outstanding results within our ads business were driven by continued optimization of Promoted Listings standard, and expansion of our emerging products like advanced and external Promoted Listings. As we lap one-time factors like ad portfolio expansion, recent product optimization wins, halo attribution and the one-time accounting change, we do expect the GMV delta to narrow in current levels. However, we still anticipate advertising revenue will outpace GMV for the foreseeable future. Moving to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.9% in Q2, down 1.7 points year-over-year. Roughly 1.5 points of this delta is due to the combination of eBay International Shipping and recent M&A, while FX also represented a modest year-over-year headwind. Gross margin was down roughly 80 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to a 1 point headwind from the progressive ramp of eBay International Shipping which was partly offset by an increase in take rate driven by ads and other monetization efficiencies. Further, marketing as a percentage of revenue was down nearly 80 basis points year-over-year in Q2 as our continued investment in full funnel marketing initiatives was offset by leverage on monetization efficiencies and lower spend on coupons and incentives. Product development rose by 1.1 points as we continue to invest in product and engineering talent to accelerate innovation across the platform. Our G&A expense rose by roughly 60 basis points, driven by M&A and higher employee spend. We generated non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.03 in Q2, up 5% year-over-year, benefiting from a 4% net reduction in share count from our repurchases. We delivered GAAP earnings per share of $0.32, where the delta primarily driven by unrealized losses on our equity investment portfolio. Turning to our balance sheet and capital allocation. We generated free cash flow of $492 million in Q2, up 6%. Our balance sheet position remains robust, and we ended the quarter with cash and non-equity investments of $5.3 billion and gross debt of $7.7 billion. We repurchased roughly $250 million in shares at an average price of approximately $44 during Q2 and have roughly $2.3 billion remaining under our current buyback authorization. We paid a quarterly cash dividend of $133 million in June or $0.25 per share. Our investment portfolio is detailed on Slide 20 of our earnings presentation. Our major equity investments and warrants were valued at over $3.4 billion at the end of Q2. This represents a decrease of approximately $200 million sequentially, driven primarily by the recent share price decline in Adevinta. Moving on to our outlook. For the third quarter, we forecast GMV between $17.6 billion and $18 billion, representing organic FX-neutral growth between negative 4% and negative 1% year-over-year. We expect revenue between $2.46 billion and $2.52 billion, representing organic FX-neutral growth between 2% and 4% year-over-year. We anticipate non-GAAP operating margin to fall between 25.8% to 26.5%, and we forecast non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.96 and $1.01, representing EPS growth between negative 4% and positive 1% year-over-year. We are currently planning our business around the assumption of total FX-neutral GMV growth between negative 2% and negative 1% year-over-year for the full year of 2023. We expect revenue to outpace GMV by approximately 4.5 points for the full year on a spot basis. Although FX neutral revenue growth should continue to outpace GMV by mid single digits during the second half, at current FX rates, our year-over-year growth in spot revenue and GMV would converge in Q4 as we lapped significant FX hedging gains in the prior year period. We are now planning for full year 2023 non-GAAP operating margins between 27% and 27.4%. Our margin assumptions contemplate a year-over-year headwind of roughly 1 point from the combination of recent M&A and the eBay International Shipping program. However, we do expect the operating margin impact from eIS to abide [Phonetic] by the fourth quarter. Our margin assumptions imply more than $100 million of opex savings from our structural cost program in 2023, which will be redeployed into strategic objectives. If foreign currencies hold at current rates, FX would represent a tailwind of roughly 0.5 point to GMV growth for the full year in 2023. However, FX would represent roughly 0.5 points headwind to operating margin for 20223 with approximately 2 points of impact during Q4 alone due to hedging gains in the prior year period. FX also represents more than a 2-point headwind to non-GAAP EPS for the full year. Lastly, for the full year, we expect to generate just under $2 billion in free cash flow. Due to California State disaster tax relief, the majority of our cash tax payments scheduled for 2023 have been deferred and will be paid in October. As such, we expect the bulk of our remaining 2023 free cash flow to be recognized in Q3. We estimate our non-GAAP tax rate will remain unchanged at 16.5% throughout the rest of 2023. Our capital expenditures for the full year are still estimated to be between 4% to 6% of revenue. In closing, Q2 was another strong quarter for eBay as we delivered against our quarterly financial commitments and made significant progress on our long-term strategic objectives. Focus categories expanded in coverage positively influence growth for the marketplace overall. Our advertising business is driving robust growth at scale as first-party ads meaningfully accelerating relative to GMV. We continue to invest in products and full funnel marketing initiatives in a disciplined manner laying the foundation for sustainable growth. And we generated $492 million of free cash flow, returned $383 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends and have returned roughly 130% of free cash flow to shareholders over the last 18 months. I continue to be inspired by the accelerating pace of innovation at eBay as we reinvent the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts. With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions."

The global economy is facing growing headwinds amid rising interest rates, heightened geopolitical tensions, and lingering pandemic effects. The economic slowdown and rising interest rates could lead to higher nonperforming loans as it becomes more challenging for borrowers to repay and service their debts. Persistent and high levels of nonperforming loans in turn could undermine bank lending and economic recovery. Nonperforming loans held by banks in Asia totaled $794 billion at the end of 2021 (up from $766 billion in 2020 and $692 billion in 2019) according to official figures. During the pandemic, fiscal stimulus helped prevent corporate defaults, while easing regulations relieved pressure on banks to pursue repayment. The phasing out of regulatory forbearance, global monetary tightening and challenging economic and financial conditions could pose a significant risk to banks’ asset quality, increasing nonperforming loans in the near future. To avoid rising nonperforming loan ratios, diminishing bank lending capacity and worsening economic performance, it is important to strengthen the way nonperforming loans are repaid or resolved. Nonperforming loan resolution – the disposal of nonperforming loans from banks’ balance sheets – can be made more efficient through private nonperforming loan markets. At present, the level of nonperforming loan market development differs considerably across Asia. For example, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, and the People’s Republic of China have active nonperforming loan markets, while differing in their characteristics, including the degree of international investor involvement. Many other countries in Asia and the Pacific are at an earlier stage of nonperforming loan market development, such as Viet Nam and Kazakhstan. Impediments to nonperforming loan market development include a limited number of active investors, and scarce information around market prices and volumes. Furthermore, the institutional environment plays an important role, with poor legal framework legislation, weak collateral enforcement and insolvency proceedings adding to the market imperfections. As a result, there is often a considerable gap between the price an investor is willing to pay and the price a bank is willing to accept for a nonperforming loan. E-transaction platforms for nonperforming loans can address some of these market impediments more efficiently. Such platforms would create an online marketplace, bringing together buyers and sellers in the digital space, and help information flows. First, e-transaction platforms can reduce information asymmetry inherent in any financial transaction, as the seller would have more information on the value of an asset being sold than the buyer. This can be done by offering data review, validation, and also warehousing functions. Standardized nonperforming loan data templates can help in that regard, enhancing granularity, quality, transparency, and comparability of nonperforming loan-related information that are key to potential investors. Second, e-transaction platforms can enhance efficiency of transactions and price discovery among market participants. As in any other online retail platform, market participants can be matched and exchange information online. This can lower transaction costs and operation efficiency. Anecdotal evidence suggests e-platform operators could offer much faster execution of transactions, with 55% to 90% time saved, compared to conventional offline processes. Small investors could also find it easier to join this marketplace, helping broaden the investor base. Pricing mechanisms can also be facilitated through e-platforms, improving pricing efficiency. For example, e-platforms can facilitate a competitive online bidding process (much like eBay auctions) upon review of the specific asset information submitted by the sellers and the necessary due diligence. Third, e-transaction platforms can attract foreign investors. There are also some e-trading platforms in the European Union that facilitate both domestic and cross-border trades of nonperforming loans. Currently, however, existing nonperforming loan markets in Asia tend to be dominated by domestic players. While this is also due to legal impediments, such as restrictions of foreign ownership, foreign investors could be attracted to this platform for greater transparency and lower cost. Especially for smaller markets and countries, a platform facilitating overseas investment could vitalize their nonperforming loan markets. Nonperforming loan collection practices should be regulated to protect consumers and borrowers. There are a few key considerations for the establishment of e-transaction platforms in the region. The region’s financial markets have long been held back by fragmentation and the same is true for e-platforms. The People’s Republic of China has several active e-platforms for nonperforming loans, including through popular online retail platforms. However, these e-platforms are segmented without mechanisms for standardization and interoperability. Consolidating e-trading platforms will help reduce costs while offering multiple benefits of efficiency gains. For nonperforming loan transaction platforms to function smoothly, including across borders, harmonization of regulatory and reporting requirements is crucial. For instance, the adoption of agreed international standards of nonperforming loan recognition and valuation is important. Minimum standards in the form of best practice guidelines could further incentivize active market participation. Adoption of nonperforming loan data templates, possibly mandatory, can further help. An enabling legal framework and infrastructure are key to promoting nonperforming loan markets and thus also e-transaction platforms. For example, regulations need to offer clear guidelines and legal proceedings for effective workout and resolution of nonperforming loans while protecting borrowers’ rights. Multiple factors should be considered on balance. Nonperforming loan collection practices should be regulated to protect consumers and borrowers, while practices should not restrict lenders’ ability to efficiently work out nonperforming loans. This needs to be accommodated through strong judicial capacity and infrastructure, including sufficient court capacity to swiftly resolve disputes. A non-discriminatory level playing field would attract diverse investors, both in nonperforming loan markets in general and e-platforms in particular. That is, regulatory requirements should be applied equally to both foreign and domestic market participants, reducing possible entry barriers. Finally, given that Asia’s nonperforming loan markets and ecosystems are at different stages of maturity and depth, exchange of knowledge and experience would be important. Potential policy support could lead to the establishment of a nonperforming loan transaction platform in the region—or a network thereof—that features common standards. Setting regional standards to support cross-border transactions could maximize the reach of the nonperforming loan transaction platform and enhance its effectiveness.

Excel enables the user to cope with the big data scenario consisting of 3 H’s - high volume, high velocity, and high variety. It also makes data capture and processing more manageable, making exploratory and ad hoc data analysis favorable. Based on many years of experience, we have compiled the ten most important and advanced Excel formulas that every world-class financial analyst must know. Not only can these functions help shave minutes off your work, but they also allow the overall Excel worksheet to be more fleshed out and connected. While it may not sound like much, these minutes can eventually add up to hours of saved work. Below is the countdown of the most advanced and helpful Excel formulas to take your modeling skills to the next level. 10. INDEX MATCH INDEX MATCH is one of the most essential Excel functions. It is a combination of two functions that are almost always used together. This advanced function searches for a particular value(s) in a list and returns the relative position of that value in the list. It allows the user to create two-way lookups, left lookups, case-sensitive lookups, and even lookups based on different criteria assigned by the user. Unlike VLOOKUP (which can use the value from only the first column), it lets you use the lookup value from any column. Furthermore, VLOOKUP can be slower as it returns an exact value, while INDEX MATCH only returns a reference value. For example, to find the hobby for “Jim” in column D, one would use INDEX MATCH with the following formula: =INDEX(D3:D5, MATCH(\"Jim\", C3:C5)) Here, the MATCH function looks for the value, and then the INDEX function returns the relative position of that value, which is “Music” in this case. 9. IF combined with AND/OR The IF formula allows the user to make logical comparisons between two different values and returns a value based on the comparison result, i.e., different values for TRUE and FALSE outcomes. However, sometimes the data parameters can be numerous, generating a need for more than one IF function to test the various conditions and the result they return. During such instances, nested-IF statements can increase the number of feasible outcomes. It can be used in conjunction with AND/OR where AND/OR test multiple conditions to return specific values based on the fulfillment of conditions. For example, consider the marks of subjects English and Math for fifth grade students. To progress to the next grade, the students must pass both subjects. The passing mark for both papers is 35. We can check whether the students passed by using IF in conjunction with AND. In this case, we will use the following formula to check if the condition of 35 marks is fulfilled for both subjects. =IF(AND(D5>35, E5>35), “PASS”, “FAIL”) We get the results as: We see that since Harry and Nicholas both have received marks below 35 in English and Maths, respectively, they will not progress to the next grade. Let’s assume that a new principal takes over the school administration who feels that obtaining the passing grade in both subjects is too harsh for the students. Therefore, they decide that students can progress to the next grade if they get passing marks in either of the subjects. This means that a student scoring above 35 in English OR Maths will advance to the next grade. This brings us to the following combination: IF with OR. We will use the following formula to check the pass and fail status. =IF(OR(D5>35, E5>35), “PASS”, “FAIL”) Now we see that all the students pass the exam and progress onto the next grade (Yay!).

OFFSET combined with SUM or AVERAGE This is a beneficial formula that lets you do some powerful analysis in Excel. The OFFSET function lets you create a new range starting at any cell or row, based on the number of rows and columns to offset, and the SUM or AVERAGE functions operate on all of the cells in that new range, respectively. This means if you want to summarize your data by column (or row) but don’t know how many columns (or rows) there are, you can use this formula to find out the sum or average of your data. Let’s say you want to find the total amount of revenue generated from an online store for the first ten days. You have several lines of data for each item sold, as shown below: You can create a dynamic formula using the combination of SUM and OFFSET. Then, whenever you add a new line of revenue data, the formula will automatically calculate the total revenue up to the recent date. Below is the formula that will give you the dynamic sum. =SUM(D4:OFFSET(D14, -1, 0)) Suppose we add the total sales data for Day 11. Then, we simply insert a row below day 10 and add the sales value as $2,000. You will notice that your formula automatically captures the latest value and gives you the updated sum of the total sales. Similarly, you can use the AVERAGE() function to determine the average sales done up to the recent date or a single month. For example, the following formula will give you the average value of sales done up to the recent period. =AVERAGE(D4:OFFSET(D15,-1,0)) 7. CHOOSE CHOOSE is a useful function for when you want to pick a value from a list of possibilities. You can use CHOOSE when you need to enter an option in Excel, and the user can select from a list of choices. For instance, it is often used in survey type questionnaires when you want people to answer with one of three possible answers. The syntax for CHOOSE is given below. =CHOOSE(index,value1,value2,...) Here, index is a number between 1 and the total number of values. For example, please consider the following list. If you type “CHOOSE(2)”, it will return “Green,” and if you enter “CHOOSE(5)”, it will return “White.” Note: The CHOOSE function can include reference values but will fail to retrieve values from a range or array constant. For example, the below formula will return “White.” =CHOOSE(5, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11) But, if you use the following formula, it will throw the #VALUE error. =CHOOSE(5, C4:C11) This function is perfect for when you have lots of data listed in order. In addition, you can use this function to pick numbers for graphs and other calculations. 6. XNPV and XIRR XNPV calculates net present value, which takes the future cash flow into account and calculates how much that cash flow is worth today, while XIRR calculates internal rate of return, which calculates the rate of return on an investment based on its cash flows. As opposed to the IRR function, which assumes that the cash flows occur at regular intervals, the XIRR function considers the dates when the cash flows occur, making it easier to calculate the actual internal rate of return for nonperiodic cash flows. XNPV and XIRR are closely related formulas since the internal rate of return is the discount rate in DCF analysis that makes the net present value of all cash flows equal to zero. Hence, these are essential formulas to have at your disposal because they enable you to analyze investments with different timelines. Assume that you invest $2,000 by purchasing a vending machine from eBay and expect to earn cash flows from it for the next five years. We can find the internal rate of return by using the following formula. =XIRR(C4:C9, D4:D9) Here, column D indicates the date of cash flows after eliminating the maintenance and inventory refill cost. A business like this can have unequal timings of cash flows based on the owner’s preferences of withdrawing coins from the machine. When we compare IRR and XIRR for the same cash flows, we find a significant difference between the results given by both functions. This dissimilarity is created by unequal cash flows and can be reduced if the payments occur at regular intervals. 5. SUMIF and COUNTIF The next advanced Excel formulas we will cover are SUMIF and COUNTIF. There is a slight difference between the two, which we will explain below. We will also show you an example of how to use both in Excel. SUMIF Formula The SUMIF formula is used to add numbers that meet specific criteria. The syntax for this formula is as follows: =SUMIF(range, criteria, sum_range) For example, if you need to find the salary given to the employees in January from the disoriented data below, you can use the above formula as shown below. =SUMIF(C6:C11, ” Jan”, E6:E11) In this example, our range is C6:C11, and our criteria is “Jan.” In this case, the sum_range would be E6:E11. This formula will return $20,000 because two salaries were paid in Jan. COUNTIF Formula The COUNTIF formula counts the number of cells that meet a specific criterion. The syntax for the formula is as follows: =COUNTIF(range, criteria) For example, assume that you are comparing loan amounts from two different spreadsheets during one of the reconciliation works for a mortgage lending firm. The data is as below: Now you must check whether the loan amounts from both spreadsheets reconcile. This can be done with a simple formula of =C5=D5. This will compare both values and give a TRUE result if values are the same and FALSE if values are different in column E. The final step is using the COUNTIF formula, which will summarize how many value comparisons return FALSE. In cell E3, typing the following formula will give you a count of all the cells with FALSE as the value. =COUNTIF(E5:E12, “FALSE”) Since the significance of reconciliation is to highlight discrepancies in the data, such simple formulas make the task a lot easier. 4. PMT and IPMT These two Excel formulas are used to calculate the payment on an installment loan. The PMT formula calculates the monthly payment, while the IPMT formula calculates the interest payment. The difference between these two formulas is that the PMT formula calculates payments for a loan with constant interest rates. In contrast, the IPMT formula calculates payments for a loan with interest rates that change over time. The syntax for PMT function is as follows. =PMT(rate, nper, pv, [fv], [type]) where, rate = interest rate for the loan nper = number of payments for the loan pv = present value of the loan fv = future value of the loan. (Optional parameter) type = indicates whether the payments are made in the beginning (type = 1) or end of the period (type = 0). (Optional parameter) To use either of these formulas, you will need to input three pieces of information: Principle, Rate, and Number of Payments. To find out how much your monthly payment would be on a $20,000 car at a 6% annual rate with a tenure of 5 years (60 monthly payments), you would enter the formula in a cell and get a result of $386.66. =PMT(D5/12, D6, D4) Since it’s an annual rate, we need to divide it by 12 for monthly installments. Similarly, if we are paying the loan weekly, the same formula could be rewritten as shown below, and we will get $89.08 as the weekly payment on the loan. =PMT(D5/52, D6*52, D4) Suppose you have another loan of $20,000 for a car with a 12% rate that can be paid in a single year, i.e., in 12 monthly payments. What if you need to find how much interest you paid in the fifth month out of the total installment amount? You can use the IPMT function that will return you the interest paid in period ‘n.’ But first, you need to calculate PMT, which would be $1,776.98 in this case, using the below formula. =PMT(D5, D6, -C4) The syntax for IPMT function is: =IPMT(rate, per, nper, pv, [fv], [type]) where, rate = interest rate for the loan per = number of payments over which interest needs to be calculated nper = number of payments on the loan pv = present value of the loan fv = future value of the loan. It is an optional parameter. type = indicates whether the payments are made at the beginning (type = 1) or the end of the period (type = 0). It is also an optional parameter. Using the following formula will give $135.97 as the interest amount of the installment, while the rest is the principal amount ($1,776.98 - $135.97 = $1,641.01). =IPMT(C5/12, 5, C6*12, -C4) We have calculated the interest amount due for each month in the below table for your reference. 3. LEN and TRIM LEN() and TRIM() are two Excel formulas that you’ll find yourself using more often than others. LEN(), also known as the length function, returns the length of a text argument by calculating the number of characters in the string. TRIM() is used to remove any leading or trailing spaces from a text argument except for a single space between words. For example, assume that your data set has the following value in a cell. “John Doe 123 Main Street ABC corp” It has a lot of irregular spacing, making the data inconsistent with the other related fields and complicating the analysis. We can use the TRIM() function to remove the unnecessary spaces between text in cell C5. By using the simple formula TRIM(“C5”), you will get the result as “John Doe 123 Main Street ABC corp” and LEN(“D5”) will return 33. In short, if you want to know how many characters are in a text string, use LEN, and if you need to know what is between two words with spaces, use TRIM. 2. CONCATENATE The CONCATENATE function is a powerful function that will combine two strings of text, or two cells in a spreadsheet, into one. This formula can be used when you have a list of people’s names and need to create a column with their full names. Simply type the names in separate cells and use this formula to combine them! For example, let’s consider the first and last names below and combine them into their full name. Below is the syntax for the CONCATENATE function. =CONCATENATE(text1, [text2]...) We will be using this formula with specific parameters given below to join the first and last name in column E. =CONCATENATE(C4, “ ”, D4) Do you notice we have used quotation marks with a space (“ ”) in between them in the formula? It is to produce the space between the two names without which we would get our result as “JohnMcqueen.” You can also use the &(ampersand) character to combine text from different cells to generate similar results. Below is the formula to concatenate strings using the ampersand character. =C4&“ ”&D4 It is a matter of personal choice whether the analyst uses =CONCATENATE or the ampersand to join strings. 1. CELL, LEFT, MID, and RIGHT functions The CELL function will provide you with information about a cell in Excel. The LEFT, MID, and RIGHT functions will extract characters from a text string. The LEFT function discards everything to the left of the first character. In contrast, the MID function takes everything between the beginning and the end, ignoring spaces between words, and the RIGHT function discards everything to the right of the last character. For example, assume that you have the value “John Doe 123 Main Street ABC corp.” in an unknown cell in Excel. To determine the cell address, we will use the below formula with “address” as the info type parameter to return the cell's address. =CELL(“address”, C5) Similarly, you can use different parameters to find information related to the cell. Using LEFT, RIGHT, and MID() functions, we can extract characters out of one cell and into another cell. The num_chars is an optional parameter in the syntax for all three functions that determine the number of characters to be extracted from the selected text. Using a combination including these three functions, you can extract data from an entire column or row in Excel without using many different formulas. For example, if you want to get every person’s first name in your spreadsheet, type the following in cell E6 and copy it down till E10 to separate the last names from the full names in column C. =LEFT(C6, FIND(“ ”, C6)) Important things to remember A formula begins with the equal sign (=), without which any input function/formula will be represented as text in our spreadsheet. A space counts as a single character and must be considered while using functions such as MID, LEFT, RIGHT, and TRIM. Text values in formulas should be given inside quotation marks (“ ”). Else, the formulas won’t give you the correct value or show you an error. Try Excel practice exercises with some of these formulas here.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Jamie. Jamie Iannone President and Chief Executive Officer at eBay Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2022 was a year of consistent execution for eBay, as we made significant progress against our long-term objectives. Our focused categories drove underlying growth in our business, as we expanded global coverage for our 16 million enthusiast buyers. In Motors Parts and Accessories or P&A growth accelerated as we improved our fitment capabilities, increased supply of OEM parts, and enhanced trust signals for buyers. We extended authentication to new categories like trading cards and fine jewelry, and opened authentication centers in several new countries for handbags. We opened the vault to store and individually transact valuable items, and adoption has grown steadily week over week. We retired legacy technology, simplified the architecture of our core services, and improved our tech velocity. Our advertising growth accelerated as we scaled our three newer Promoted Listings products, optimized performance, and automated more elements of campaigns. We expanded our financial services portfolio by adding FX conversions, new forms of payments like Klarna and Afterpay, faster debit card payouts, and a digital wallet. And we balanced our investments in innovation with prudent cost discipline to establish a strong foundation for sustainable profitable growth for many years to come. Now turning to the fourth quarter. We delivered solid results in Q4 as our key financial metrics came in ahead of expectations, despite the ongoing macro uncertainty. We generated over $18 billion in GMV, and more than $2.5 billion in revenue. We delivered an operating margin of close to 30% while making critical investments in product and marketing to support our long-term growth strategy. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $1.07, up 2% year-over-year. Our focus category strategy was a major component of our strong financial performance during the fourth quarter. Focus categories grew more than 7 points faster than the rest of our marketplace during Q4, which was 2 points faster than the prior quarter. Establishing a game-changing level of trust between sellers and buyers has been an important driver of the momentum in our focus categories. Authenticity Guarantee enables trust in our luxury categories like watches, sneakers, handbags, and fine jewelry. We have observed notable turnarounds in GMV growth since we launched authentication, improved the product experience, and grew awareness to the great inventory in these categories. In aggregate, our luxury-focused categories have grown at roughly double-digit CAGR since Q4 of 2019, proving these investments have been highly effective. We dramatically improved trust in our refurbished offering by introducing warranties, and half of re-returns, which attracted more brands and new categories to our marketplace. Those investments paid dividends in Q4, with positive year-over-year GMV growth, and the biggest sales week ever for refurbished goods during Cyber Week. Trust in our Motors Parts and Accessories category is most reliant on fitment, for ensuring the compatibility of auto parts with a specific vehicle. During the last few months, we have taken major steps forward with our fitment capabilities. We acquired myFitment in Q3, to help sellers populate their listings with accurate fitment data, which ensures compatibility for buyers. In Q4, we began making myFitment's technology accessible to all buyers, starting with a pilot group of P&A sellers. Listings enhanced by this technology are seeing a measurable uplift in conversion, and we will expand this program further in 2023. Our significant investments in fitment over the past few years allowed us to launch a prominent Fit Your Vehicle badge in Q4. Similar to the Authenticity Guaranteed logo we show on luxury goods, this badge provides a clear indication of which parts fits your vehicle throughout the buyer journey across search, merchandising, view item, and checkout. This is no small feat with over 500 million active P&A listings on eBay, and the increasing complexity of vehicles in the marketplace. These advancements have significantly elevated our capabilities for P&A shoppers, and I'm pleased to share a new program we launched just last week called eBay Guaranteed Fit. This program is the breakthrough for trust and P&A that Authenticity Guarantee is in luxury, and warranties are for eBay Refurbished. It provides buyers with assurance that eBay will stand behind them, if a part doesn't fit their vehicle. Guaranteed Fit is a huge milestone for the P&A category, and the culmination of our multi-year fitment journey. I'm incredibly proud of our teams for executing the foundational work, making this program possible, and I'm looking forward to seeing their continued innovation in the category. I'm also excited about our team's work in collectibles, which has benefited from a steady cadence of product development and partnerships, including most recently, our live commerce beta. During Q4, we scaled up a number of eBay live events with select sellers, bringing healthy level of viewers, engagement, and GMV to participating sellers. We also introduced the eBay Live Hub, where users can subscribe to channels, and receive notifications about future events. This hub will serve as a central discovery point as we broaden the availability of live commerce to more sellers and categories this year. Our acquisition of TCGplayer has also greatly enhanced our collectibles category, and in Q4, we began developing synergies between our respective marketplaces. In addition to its customer base of nearly 800,000 hobbyists, a major competitive advantage for TCGplayer is its relationship with thousands of local brick-and-mortar hobby shops with many subscribing to its point of sale and channel management solution. Due to this software, sellers can now more easily streamline listings and inventory, on both TCGplayer and eBay. TCGplayer also further diversified its marketplace by introducing Comex [Phonetic] during Q4, which is a natural adjacency to collectible card games. eBay's historical sales data enabled TCGplayer to launch Comex [Phonetic] with robust pricing intelligence, which will help us scale this offering. While our integration is in its early days, I'm incredibly excited to see what TCGplayer community will bring to eBay over time. One of the key pillars of our strategy is being the platform of choice for sellers. eBay's scale and global footprint represent key advantages for our platform as we work toward achieving this vision. In 2022, roughly one-fifth of our GMV was facilitated through cross-border trade. Sellers who activate their listings internationally can reach buyers in over 200 countries globally. However, less than half of the inventory in our Top 3 markets is currently available for export, due to the friction associated with these transactions. To unlock more valuable inventory for global buyers, last fall, we announced a major revamp of our cross-border capabilities with the launch of eBay International Shipping. Under this program, eBay handles any customs forms, coordinates duties with buyers, and intermediates returns. Sellers are protected from item not received complaints, while buyers benefit from greater selection and lower shipping costs. The program is resonating well, as we gradually ramp enrollment for sellers, while buyer satisfaction on eBay international shipping transactions reached 80%. Steve will discuss the financial implications of this program, and I'm confident it will increase cross-border inventory and drive incremental GMV for eBay. Investments in AI are also improving customer perception of our shipping capabilities. In Q4, we deployed a new machine learning model for estimated delivery date in the U.S. and select international markets, enabling us to make more accurate delivery predictions to buyers. Applying this model in the U.S. reduced the average delivery estimate by 1.5 days for all domestic listings, resulting in a noticeable uplift in conversion. A separate model deployed for eligible Authenticity Guarantee products resulted in an average reduction of approximately two days for U.S. listings. These rollouts are just the latest example of our ability to leverage AI to make our existing processes more efficient, which will be a continued focus for us in 2023 and beyond. Moving on to ads. Our marketplace continues to benefit from innovation in our advertising business, which delivered strong growth in Q4, despite headwinds in the broader digital ad market. Promoted Listings drove first-party ad revenue of $276 million, up 27% or more than 30 points faster than GMV growth. Over 2 million sellers adopted a single ad product in Q4, and we eclipsed $700 million live Promoted Listings. Additionally, our total ad revenue is nearing 1.8% penetration of GMV. Promoted Listing Standard was again the largest contributor to growth, both on a sequential and an annual basis as optimization gains from prior quarters continued to benefit ad rates. In Q4, we also improved our merchandising algorithms to show a greater diversity of products, which improves buyer satisfaction, while also preserving relevance and conversion. Our newer ad products also continued to scale nicely in Q4, and grew more than 20% quarter-over-quarter. Promoted Listings Advanced, our cost per click product, continues to be a standout among the new products. Seller adoption of Advanced has grown as we have expanded access and automated more elements of campaign management, to make this powerful ad unit easier to use. In Q4, we launched Quick Setup, a one-click campaign creation solution for sellers, where eBay automates and optimizes the campaign structure, ad groups, targeting, and keyword bids for CPC advertisers. We also introduced multi-user account access across our full suite of Promoted Listings, which enables eBay sellers to delegate campaign management, to trusted third parties like brands or ad agencies. Turning to payments. We continue to roll out additional payment services to support high ASP transactions and improve buyer conversion. During Q4, we introduced split payments in the U.S. for transactions over $1,000, enabling buyers to spread large purchases across two credit cards. We've already processed transactions from thousands of buyers, at an average order value of over $3,000, and we're excited to expand this offering globally later this year, to better support our focus categories. Additionally, building on the success of Afterpay, we recently partnered with Zip to introduce a suite of buy now, pay later options to our Australian buyers. Zip supports purchases of up to $10,000, extending our ASP coverage in this valuable market. By managing our end-to-end payments process, we are also able to leverage our own proprietary risk models to assess transaction requests across our marketplace. Last year, our risk and protections team, with our enhanced controls that allowed us to approve transactions that may have otherwise been declined in the past, enabling over $0.5 billion of annualized GMV, and reducing potential escalations to customer service. In connection with risk management, we continue to invest in the security of our marketplace to ensure our capabilities remain world-class. Last week, we announced the acquisition of 3PM Shield, a provider of state-of-the-art marketplace compliance tool. 3PM Shield offers effective solutions for the prevention, and identification of counterfeit listings and prohibited items. Combining this technology with our proprietary data, will further enhance the integrity of our marketplace. Before we move on, I'd like to touch on the actions we've taken to sharpen our focus as a company and run our business more efficiently, particularly in light of the uncertain economic environment. Earlier this month, we made the difficult decision to eliminate approximately 500 jobs, or roughly 4% of our global employee base. This decision followed a thoughtful review of our organization to ensure our people and roles were aligned with priorities, that advance eBay's commitment to long-term sustainable growth. These changes provide additional flexibility for us to invest efficiently and create new roles in high potential areas of our business, like new technologies, trusted customer experiences, and key markets. There is no easy way to say goodbye to our talented colleagues. Their passion and accomplishments over the last few years have helped us get us to where we are today. We are incredibly thankful for their contributions, and are committed to supporting them through this difficult transition. Next, I'd like to share a few milestones from our ESG efforts last year, starting with recommerce. In 2022, our marketplace generated $4.6 billion in positive economic impact through the sale of pre-loved and refurbished goods. This activity avoided 1.6 million metric tons of carbon emissions and kept 73,000 metric tons of waste from going into landfills. Recommerce continues to provide significant economic benefit for sellers and buyers during these uncertain times, and buying pre-loved items shows no sign of slowing down. In fact, just yesterday, we published our third annual Recommerce Report, which found that 90% of surveyed respondents engaged in recommerce during 2022. Cost savings were the most popular motivator for buying pre-loved, especially among Gen Z buyers. 64% of whom said its financial savings as a primary reason for shopping recommerce and sustainability was the second most important factor, with people increasingly turning to pre-loved to help the environment. This positions us well as we continue to pave the way as an industry leader, enabling economic empowerment and sustainability through our platform. Now, let's turn to impact. I'm always amazed by the tremendous generosity of the eBay community. In Q4, eBay for Charity enabled sellers and buyers to raise more than $35 million. And for the year, customers raised over $163 million. This represents an all-time high in fund raised through eBay for Charity, since we started this program 20 years ago. The eBay Foundation granted nearly $23 million in 2022, primarily to non-profit organizations, advancing inclusive entrepreneurship, and through our employee matching gift programs. This represents another all-time high for annual foundation grants. I am fortunate to lead a purpose-driven company with a team dedicated to helping communities around the world, while protecting our planet. For the fourth year in a row, eBay was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World and North American indices. We were also included on CDP's A List for 2022, which recognizes companies that are leading the way in environmental transparency and performance on climate change. Additionally, eBay ranks Number 1 on Cross-Border Commerce Europe's list of the top sustainable marketplaces operating in Europe. Looking to 2023, I'm incredibly excited about the road map ahead of us. Today, I'll offer just a glimpse of a few areas where you should expect to see progress from us this year. We'll continue to innovate for customers in our focus categories, and extend to new countries and categories this year. We will continue our work in P&A, by expanding the guaranteed FIT program and Fit Your Vehicle badge globally. We'll also grow our tire installation capabilities, after we began improving the end-to-end tire shopping experience, and broaden our network of installation partners in five markets during Q4. We'll ramp assets in the vault, and extend eligibility for more collectible items. While integrations with TCG player and known Origin will strengthen our value proposition for collectors, we will also continue to iterate next-gen shopping features like live commerce, to better engage with enthusiasts, and we will further develop the category landing pages we debut for sneakers, watches, and handbags in Q4, which offer trending inventory and personalized recommendations, powered by machine learning. Sellers across our marketplace will benefit from the expansion of our international shipping program to more markets, which will drive incremental GMV, as sellers tap into our global demand. We will continue to scale our advertising offerings, as we track toward our next $1 billion by 2025, we'll simplify and grow adoption of float listings advance, deliver more AI-driven optimization, and further expand our ads portfolio. Finally, just as we have done in focus categories, this year we will adapt our one-size-fits-all approach, to build more relevant and compelling localized experiences, in some of our European markets. We will enhance local discoverability, reduce friction through simplified selling experiences, offer new local forms of payment, and address other market-specific experience gaps in search, language, and return policies. In closing, I would like to thank our extraordinary eBay employees for their accomplishments this year. Their unrelenting focus on serving our community has supported our sellers and buyers during these challenging economic times. I'm confident that with our talented eBay team, our strategic vision, and a persistent focus on operational excellence, we will continue to develop compelling experiences for customers, and create long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you. Steve Priest Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer at eBay Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with highlights from the fourth quarter on Slide 9 of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll review our key operating and financial metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the first quarter and some additional color on 2023, before we begin Q&A. As usual, my comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons on an FX-neutral basis, unless I note otherwise. We delivered solid results in Q4, as our key financial metrics exceeded expectations, and landed near the high end or above our expected guidance at ages [Phonetic]. Gross merchandise volume declined 6% to $18.2 billion, while FX was a 6-point headwind to reported growth. Revenue was down 1% to approximately $2.5 billion, which outpaced volume by 5 points, primarily due to FX and robust growth within our advertising business. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29.9%, down 1.8 points due to volume deleverage, and continued investment in marketing to support the strategic initiatives. We delivered $1.07 of non-GAAP earnings per share, up 2% year-over-year, and we generated $533 million of free cash flow, up 43% year-over-year, while returning $419 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Our Q4 results demonstrate the continued resilience of our marketplace, amid economic uncertainty. I'm extremely proud of our teams delivering on their quarterly financial commitments, maintaining prudent cost discipline, and executing key deliverables in support of our long-term growth objectives. Let's take a closer look at our financial performance during the fourth quarter. Gross merchandise volume is down 6% year-over-year, decelerating roughly 1 point sequentially. Our business remains resilient, despite headwinds from geopolitical uncertainty, inflationary pressures, low consumer confidence, and rising interest rates. Additionally, FX was a headwind of approximately 6 points of GMV, roughly 0.5 point greater than Q3. Momentum in focus categories continues to drive underlying growth in our business. In aggregate, focus categories outgrew the remainder of our marketplace by over 7 points year-over-year during Q4, roughly 2 points faster than the prior quarter delta. Motors Parts and Accessories growth accelerated sequentially, and remained the largest contributor to this outperformance. And we are excited to see what recent rollouts like Fit Your Vehicle badge and Guaranteed Fit program will do for momentum in this category. Refurbished goods also contributed positively to growth in Q4, as we continue to expand to new brands and categories. We've also made the onboarding process for third-party sellers more scalable, to increase the breadth and depth of refurbished selection on our marketplace. Within our luxury and trading cards categories, we continued to see healthy trends in authenticated item transactions in Q4, which has mitigated the macro-driven ASP pressure, observed across these industries, in recent months. As you'll recall, we closed the acquisition of TCGplayer at the end of October. A partial quarter of GMV, revenue, and expenses are included in our financials for Q4, but based on the timing of the deal close, TCGplayer's contribution is not material to results. Looking at our business on a geographic basis, our U.S. GMV declined 9% year-over-year in Q4, decelerating by roughly 2 points versus the prior quarter. International GMV declined 4% on an FX neutral basis, which was stable sequentially. Compared to Q4 of 2019, our total marketplace grew 2%, a deceleration from 6% last quarter. Versus 2019, U.S. GMV rose 12% in Q4, while international GMV was down 5%. Although macro headwinds remain more pronounced in Europe, our focus category strategy continued to drive underlying growth internationally, including positive year-over-year growth in P&A, and notable strength in luxury categories during Q4. Moving to active buyers. 134 million active buyers shopped on eBay during the trailing 12 months. We had 132 million active buyers, excluding our TCGplayer acquisition, and buyers from our Turkey business, where we ceased operations in July. Excluding these impacts, active buyers were down roughly 1 million sequentially, as a gradual improvement in buyer reactivation over the past few quarters has led to modest stabilization in our active buyer counts. Enthusiast buyers accounted for over 16 million of our active buyers in Q4, down less than 0.5 million sequentially, and churn within enthusiasts remains de minimis. The net downward migration of enthusiasts to the mid-value group was also the lowest we observed, since we began disclosing these buyer groups as lapping pressure has eased in recent quarters. Average spend per enthusiast rose again sequentially, and continued to be healthy at above $3,000 annually. Turning to revenue. You'll notice in our Q4 earnings release, and upcoming 10-K that we are now presenting a single net revenues line, which better aligns our reporting with how our business is operated. We provided one final quarter of marketing services and other revenue in Slide 12 of our earnings presentation. Today, and moving forward, when we refer to take rate, we will be referencing our all-in net revenue, divided by GMV. Net revenue was down 1% to over $2.5 billion during the fourth quarter, 1 point acceleration versus Q3. Our take rate was 13.8% in Q4, up [Phonetic] roughly 40 basis points sequentially. Although FX hedge gains were the most significant driver of our sequential take rate increase in Q4, we continue to see healthy contributions in both advertising and payments revenue. Our advertising business continues to build momentum. Total ad revenue grew 19% during the quarter, while first-party ads grew 27%, outpacing volume by more than 30 points for the second straight quarter. This extraordinary result was primarily driven by optimization and performance improvements in our standard promoted listings product. Healthy growth in our newer products, most notably our cost per click ads, also contributed meaningfully. Our legacy third-party display ads were weaker in Q4, due to industry-wide headwinds over the holidays, but these ads represent an increasingly smaller portion of our mix. Managed payments contributed nearly 10 basis points to our sequential take rate expansion, driven by new financial service offerings. These include buyer and seller FX conversions, that facilitates cross-border trade, faster debit card payouts, and new [Indecipherable] transaction services, supporting our luxury categories. Importantly, both advertising and payments remain on track to meet our multiyear revenue targets, we discussed at our Investor Day. Moving to profitability, non-GAAP operating margin was 29.9% in Q4, up nearly 1 point sequentially, but down 1.8 points year-over-year. Gross margins were down modestly year-over-year due to volume deleverage, and authentication costs, partly offset by lower payment processing fees. Sales and marketing rose by over 1 point as a percentage of revenue, as we invested in full funnel marketing, to support our focused categories, while product development was relatively flat as some one-time impacts offset continued hiring of technical talent. Our G&A expense rose as a percentage of revenue, due to charitable contributions, and other one-time items. In Q4, we recognized a GAAP charge within G&A expense of $50 million related to pending legal matters. You'll see these adjustments included in our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations, in the appendix of our earnings presentation. Additional details on this accrual will be provided in our upcoming Form 10-K. We generated $1.07 of non-GAAP earnings per share in Q4, up 2% year-over-year, benefiting from a 12% reduction in share count, from our share repurchases. We delivered GAAP earnings per share of $1.23, with the delta being driven by a recovery in our equity investment portfolio. Turning to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Free cash flow grew 43% to $533 million in Q4, driven primarily by the lapping of cash tax payments on investment sales in the prior year. Our balance sheet position remains strong, as we ended the quarter with cash and non-equity investments of $5.9 billion, and gross debt of $8.9 billion, following a successful $1.2 billion debt raise in November. We repurchased roughly $300 million of shares, at an average price of approximately $42 during Q4, and have over $2.8 billion remaining under our current authorization. We paid a quarterly cash dividend of $119 million in December, or $0.22 per share. Our investment portfolio is detailed on Slide 20 of our earnings presentation. Our equity investments were valued at approximately $3.4 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. Following the sale of a de minimis number of shares in December, to satisfy regulatory requirements, our 404 million Adevinta shares were valued at roughly $2.7 billion. Our Adyen investment value is calculated based on the probability of our remaining warrant tranche investing. In addition to the acquisitions we completed in 2022, we continued to evaluate inorganic opportunities to accelerate our strategic objectives via our Build By Partner framework. We closed the acquisition of 3PM Shield last week, which will strengthen trust in our marketplace by helping us prevent and detect problematic listings with even greater precision. Moving on to our outlook. For the first quarter, we forecast GMV between $18 billion and $18.3 billion, representing organic FX neutral growth between negative 5%, and negative 4% year-over-year. This GMV outlook includes an estimated $100 million from one-time benefits already recognized in Q1, and anticipates an FX headwind to reported growth between 2 points and 3 points. We expect to generate revenue between $2.46 billion and $2.5 billion, representing organic FX neutral growth between flat and up 2% year-over-year. We anticipate a non-GAAP operating margin between 29.1% and 29.7%, and we forecast non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.05 and $1.09, representing EPS growth between flat and up 3% year-over-year. Although, we are not providing full-year guidance at this time, given the dynamic operating environment, we will share some directional color on how we are currently thinking about 2023. Our baseline expectation is that the external demand environment does not materially improve during the first half of the year, as a result of continued macro uncertainty across our largest markets. While we do see potential for an improvement in underlying economic conditions as the year progresses, it is too early to predict the second half recovery, firing out with confidence. As a result, we currently expect our sequential GMV growth beyond Q1 to roughly approximate the seasonality we observed during 2022, excluding the impact of currency. For the full year, we expect to grow total non-GAAP expenses, inclusive of cost of revenue by approximately 2% year-over-year on a spot basis, as we continue to invest in strategic growth initiatives in 2023. This forecast contemplates one-time impacts to our P&L, from recent M&A and the rollout of the eBay International Shipping program this year. These one-time factors combined are expected to represent a year-over-year headwind for operating margin of approximately 120 basis points versus 2022. Our expense growth forecast is also net of roughly $100 million of opex savings, from our structural cost program, as we continue to look inward for cost efficiencies in our business. I'd like to share some additional context on the one-time impact to margin. Over the past year, we accelerated our progress towards several core strategic objectives, through the acquisitions of TCGplayer, KnownOrigin, myFitment, and 3PM Shield. While we are excited about the synergies and long-term growth potential of these assets, layering them into a scale of the marketplace with our level of profitability does present a natural drag on margins in the short term, which will diminish, as our integration work progresses. The rollout of eBay International Shipping will improve seller velocity, and global availability of unique inventory over the long run. Our role in intermediating shipping and returns in this program, will shift us to a principal relationship with sellers, versus being an agency in our previous global shipping program. From an accounting perspective, this means revenue from the new program will be recognized on a gross basis, while the vast majority of expenses are variable, and recognize the cost of revenue. While the operating margin headwind from this program will abate as we progressively scale it through 2023, it's primarily variable costs or impact to our reported gross margins. We expect this program to generate incremental operating profit this year, despite representing a headwind of 30 basis points of gross margin in Q1, rising to 120 basis points in Q4. Additionally, we expect foreign exchange to represent a headwind of approximately 1% of GMV in 2023, and between 3% to 4% to non-GAAP EPS, following the unwinding of recent U.S. dollar strength. We forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 16.5% throughout 2023. On the capital allocation front, I'm pleased to announce our Board recently approved a 14% increase to our quarterly dividend, raising to $0.25 per share in 2023. We continue to target returning approximately 125% of free cash flow to shareholders, between 2022 and 2024, and our broader capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Our fortress balance sheet is a tremendous competitive advantage in this environment that enables us to invest organically in our business, accelerate our strategic objectives with disciplined inorganic investments, while still delivering healthy capital return to shareholders. In the current macro environment, we believe it is prudent to balance the timing and magnitude of share repurchases with our capital needs from quarter-to-quarter. Our first priority is offsetting dilution, and we expect to be opportunistic with regard to larger repurchases. In closing, our Q4 results capped off a resilient year for eBay in 2022, as we made meaningful progress towards our long-term strategy, despite significant macro uncertainty. We exceeded consensus expectations for GMV, revenue, and EPS during Q4. Our focus categories continued to outperform, and are driving underlying growth in our business. Our advertising revenue continues to meaningfully outpace volume growth, while payment initiatives continued to scale in line with expectations. We achieved a full year operating margin of 30%, despite contending with a more challenging macro environment than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. We generated nearly $2.2 billion in free cash flow in 2022 and returned over $3.6 billion to shareholders through repurchases, and dividends, equating to nearly 170% of our free cash flow. I'm proud that eBay continues to pave the way as an industry leader, enabling economic empowerment, and sustainability to our platform. We once again achieved carbon neutrality in 2022, and remain committed to reducing 90% of our carbon emissions from our operations by 2030. I'm incredibly appreciative of our team's focus and execution during 2022, as we delivered on a number of our core strategic objectives, despite navigating uncertain macro environment. I'm confident our investments in 2022 enabled us to exit the year stronger than when we entered it, keeping us on a path to sustainable long-term growth. With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions.\n\n---\n\n[2023-02-23] 2023-02-23 00:00:00\n标题: alaMaula est une marque de eBay (EBAY) Cours de l'action\n内容: Cours de Bourse et Rendement de l'action eBay (alaMaula) Cours de l'action 15/09/2023 44,56 USD Rendement (Dividende par action) 2,23 % (annualisé) Variation du cours de l'action sur 1 an +6,18 % (2018-2022) Stoxx Europe 600 : +10,30 % S&P 500 NY : +42,40 % Variation du cours de l'action sur 5 ans +30,43 % Acheter l'action eBay avec (0% de commission et fractions d'actions) Votre capital est assujetti à un risque.

        "title": "E-Transaction Platforms Could Help Protect Asia’s Banks from Nonperforming Loans",
        "content": "Subscribe to Newsletter Audio Hub By Cyn-Young Park (朴信永), Peter Rosenkranz Persistent, high levels of nonperforming loans could undermine bank lending and economic recovery in Asia’s developing countries. The global economy is facing growing headwinds amid rising interest rates, heightened geopolitical tensions, and lingering pandemic effects. The economic slowdown and rising interest rates could lead to higher nonperforming loans as it becomes more challenging for borrowers to repay and service their debts. Persistent and high levels of nonperforming loans in turn could undermine bank lending and economic recovery. Nonperforming loans held by banks in Asia totaled $794 billion at the end of 2021 (up from $766 billion in 2020 and $692 billion in 2019) according to official figures. During the pandemic, fiscal stimulus helped prevent corporate defaults, while easing regulations relieved pressure on banks to pursue repayment. The phasing out of regulatory forbearance, global monetary tightening and challenging economic and financial conditions could pose a significant risk to banks’ asset quality, increasing nonperforming loans in the near future. To avoid rising nonperforming loan ratios, diminishing bank lending capacity and worsening economic performance, it is important to strengthen the way nonperforming loans are repaid or resolved. Nonperforming loan resolution – the disposal of nonperforming loans from banks’ balance sheets – can be made more efficient through private nonperforming loan markets. At present, the level of nonperforming loan market development differs considerably across Asia. For example, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, and the People’s Republic of China have active nonperforming loan markets, while differing in their characteristics, including the degree of international investor involvement. Many other countries in Asia and the Pacific are at an earlier stage of nonperforming loan market development, such as Viet Nam and Kazakhstan. Impediments to nonperforming loan market development include a limited number of active investors, and scarce information around market prices and volumes. Furthermore, the institutional environment plays an important role, with poor legal framework legislation, weak collateral enforcement and insolvency proceedings adding to the market imperfections. As a result, there is often a considerable gap between the price an investor is willing to pay and the price a bank is willing to accept for a nonperforming loan. E-transaction platforms for nonperforming loans can address some of these market impediments more efficiently. Such platforms would create an online marketplace, bringing together buyers and sellers in the digital space, and help information flows. First, e-transaction platforms can reduce information asymmetry inherent in any financial transaction, as the seller would have more information on the value of an asset being sold than the buyer. This can be done by offering data review, validation, and also warehousing functions. Standardized nonperforming loan data templates can help in that regard, enhancing granularity, quality, transparency, and comparability of nonperforming loan-related information that are key to potential investors. Second, e-transaction platforms can enhance efficiency of transactions and price discovery among market participants. As in any other online retail platform, market participants can be matched and exchange information online. This can lower transaction costs and operation efficiency. Anecdotal evidence suggests e-platform operators could offer much faster execution of transactions, with 55% to 90% time saved, compared to conventional offline processes. Small investors could also find it easier to join this marketplace, helping broaden the investor base. Pricing mechanisms can also be facilitated through e-platforms, improving pricing efficiency. For example, e-platforms can facilitate a competitive online bidding process (much like eBay auctions) upon review of the specific asset information submitted by the sellers and the necessary due diligence. Third, e-transaction platforms can attract foreign investors. There are also some e-trading platforms in the European Union that facilitate both domestic and cross-border trades of nonperforming loans. Currently, however, existing nonperforming loan markets in Asia tend to be dominated by domestic players. While this is also due to legal impediments, such as restrictions of foreign ownership, foreign investors could be attracted to this platform for greater transparency and lower cost. Especially for smaller markets and countries, a platform facilitating overseas investment could vitalize their nonperforming loan markets. Nonperforming loan collection practices should be regulated to protect consumers and borrowers. There are a few key considerations for the establishment of e-transaction platforms in the region. The region’s financial markets have long been held back by fragmentation and the same is true for e-platforms. The People’s Republic of China has several active e-platforms for nonperforming loans, including through popular online retail platforms. However, these e-platforms are segmented without mechanisms for standardization and interoperability. Consolidating e-trading platforms will help reduce costs while offering multiple benefits of efficiency gains. For nonperforming loan transaction platforms to function smoothly, including across borders, harmonization of regulatory and reporting requirements is crucial. For instance, the adoption of agreed international standards of nonperforming loan recognition and valuation is important. Minimum standards in the form of best practice guidelines could further incentivize active market participation. Adoption of nonperforming loan data templates, possibly mandatory, can further help. An enabling legal framework and infrastructure are key to promoting nonperforming loan markets and thus also e-transaction platforms. For example, regulations need to offer clear guidelines and legal proceedings for effective workout and resolution of nonperforming loans while protecting borrowers’ rights. Multiple factors should be considered on balance. Nonperforming loan collection practices should be regulated to protect consumers and borrowers, while practices should not restrict lenders’ ability to efficiently work out nonperforming loans. This needs to be accommodated through strong judicial capacity and infrastructure, including sufficient court capacity to swiftly resolve disputes. A non-discriminatory level playing field would attract diverse investors, both in nonperforming loan markets in general and e-platforms in particular. That is, regulatory requirements should be applied equally to both foreign and domestic market participants, reducing possible entry barriers. Finally, given that Asia’s nonperforming loan markets and ecosystems are at different stages of maturity and depth, exchange of knowledge and experience would be important. Potential policy support could lead to the establishment of a nonperforming loan transaction platform in the region—or a network thereof—that features common standards. Setting regional standards to support cross-border transactions could maximize the reach of the nonperforming loan transaction platform and enhance its effectiveness.

        "title": "Advanced Excel Formulas",
        "content": "Big Data has changed how most financial institutions work in today’s age of innovation. It plays a large role in finance, where it refers to large amounts of related data whose analysis produces actionable insight and makes it easier for the investors to make better investment decisions. Excel enables the user to cope with the big data scenario consisting of 3 H’s - high volume, high velocity, and high variety. It also makes data capture and processing more manageable, making exploratory and ad hoc data analysis favorable. Based on many years of experience, we have compiled the ten most important and advanced Excel formulas that every world-class financial analyst must know. Not only can these functions help shave minutes off your work, but they also allow the overall Excel worksheet to be more fleshed out and connected. While it may not sound like much, these minutes can eventually add up to hours of saved work. Below is the countdown of the most advanced and helpful Excel formulas to take your modeling skills to the next level. 10. INDEX MATCH INDEX MATCH is one of the most essential Excel functions. It is a combination of two functions that are almost always used together. This advanced function searches for a particular value(s) in a list and returns the relative position of that value in the list. It allows the user to create two-way lookups, left lookups, case-sensitive lookups, and even lookups based on different criteria assigned by the user. Unlike VLOOKUP (which can use the value from only the first column), it lets you use the lookup value from any column. Furthermore, VLOOKUP can be slower as it returns an exact value, while INDEX MATCH only returns a reference value. For example, to find the hobby for “Jim” in column D, one would use INDEX MATCH with the following formula: =INDEX(D3:D5, MATCH(\"Jim\", C3:C5)) Here, the MATCH function looks for the value, and then the INDEX function returns the relative position of that value, which is “Music” in this case. 9. IF combined with AND/OR The IF formula allows the user to make logical comparisons between two different values and returns a value based on the comparison result, i.e., different values for TRUE and FALSE outcomes. However, sometimes the data parameters can be numerous, generating a need for more than one IF function to test the various conditions and the result they return. During such instances, nested-IF statements can increase the number of feasible outcomes. It can be used in conjunction with AND/OR where AND/OR test multiple conditions to return specific values based on the fulfillment of conditions. For example, consider the marks of subjects English and Math for fifth grade students. To progress to the next grade, the students must pass both subjects. The passing mark for both papers is 35. We can check whether the students passed by using IF in conjunction with AND. In this case, we will use the following formula to check if the condition of 35 marks is fulfilled for both subjects. =IF(AND(D5>35, E5>35), “PASS”, “FAIL”) We get the results as: We see that since Harry and Nicholas both have received marks below 35 in English and Maths, respectively, they will not progress to the next grade. Let’s assume that a new principal takes over the school administration who feels that obtaining the passing grade in both subjects is too harsh for the students. Therefore, they decide that students can progress to the next grade if they get passing marks in either of the subjects. This means that a student scoring above 35 in English OR Maths will advance to the next grade. This brings us to the following combination: IF with OR. We will use the following formula to check the pass and fail status. =IF(OR(D5>35, E5>35), “PASS”, “FAIL”) Now we see that all the students pass the exam and progress onto the next grade (Yay!). Sign Up for our Free Excel Modeling Crash Course Begin your journey into Excel modeling with our free Excel Modeling Crash Course. Learn More 8. OFFSET combined with SUM or AVERAGE This is a beneficial formula that lets you do some powerful analysis in Excel. The OFFSET function lets you create a new range starting at any cell or row, based on the number of rows and columns to offset, and the SUM or AVERAGE functions operate on all of the cells in that new range, respectively. This means if you want to summarize your data by column (or row) but don’t know how many columns (or rows) there are, you can use this formula to find out the sum or average of your data. Let’s say you want to find the total amount of revenue generated from an online store for the first ten days. You have several lines of data for each item sold, as shown below: You can create a dynamic formula using the combination of SUM and OFFSET. Then, whenever you add a new line of revenue data, the formula will automatically calculate the total revenue up to the recent date. Below is the formula that will give you the dynamic sum. =SUM(D4:OFFSET(D14, -1, 0)) Suppose we add the total sales data for Day 11. Then, we simply insert a row below day 10 and add the sales value as $2,000. You will notice that your formula automatically captures the latest value and gives you the updated sum of the total sales. Similarly, you can use the AVERAGE() function to determine the average sales done up to the recent date or a single month. For example, the following formula will give you the average value of sales done up to the recent period. =AVERAGE(D4:OFFSET(D15,-1,0)) 7. CHOOSE CHOOSE is a useful function for when you want to pick a value from a list of possibilities. You can use CHOOSE when you need to enter an option in Excel, and the user can select from a list of choices. For instance, it is often used in survey type questionnaires when you want people to answer with one of three possible answers. The syntax for CHOOSE is given below. =CHOOSE(index,value1,value2,...) Here, index is a number between 1 and the total number of values. For example, please consider the following list. If you type “CHOOSE(2)”, it will return “Green,” and if you enter “CHOOSE(5)”, it will return “White.” Note: The CHOOSE function can include reference values but will fail to retrieve values from a range or array constant. For example, the below formula will return “White.” =CHOOSE(5, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11) But, if you use the following formula, it will throw the #VALUE error. =CHOOSE(5, C4:C11) This function is perfect for when you have lots of data listed in order. In addition, you can use this function to pick numbers for graphs and other calculations. 6. XNPV and XIRR XNPV calculates net present value, which takes the future cash flow into account and calculates how much that cash flow is worth today, while XIRR calculates internal rate of return, which calculates the rate of return on an investment based on its cash flows. As opposed to the IRR function, which assumes that the cash flows occur at regular intervals, the XIRR function considers the dates when the cash flows occur, making it easier to calculate the actual internal rate of return for nonperiodic cash flows. XNPV and XIRR are closely related formulas since the internal rate of return is the discount rate in DCF analysis that makes the net present value of all cash flows equal to zero. Hence, these are essential formulas to have at your disposal because they enable you to analyze investments with different timelines. Assume that you invest $2,000 by purchasing a vending machine from eBay and expect to earn cash flows from it for the next five years. We can find the internal rate of return by using the following formula. =XIRR(C4:C9, D4:D9) Here, column D indicates the date of cash flows after eliminating the maintenance and inventory refill cost. A business like this can have unequal timings of cash flows based on the owner’s preferences of withdrawing coins from the machine. When we compare IRR and XIRR for the same cash flows, we find a significant difference between the results given by both functions. This dissimilarity is created by unequal cash flows and can be reduced if the payments occur at regular intervals. 5. SUMIF and COUNTIF The next advanced Excel formulas we will cover are SUMIF and COUNTIF. There is a slight difference between the two, which we will explain below. We will also show you an example of how to use both in Excel. SUMIF Formula The SUMIF formula is used to add numbers that meet specific criteria. The syntax for this formula is as follows: =SUMIF(range, criteria, sum_range) For example, if you need to find the salary given to the employees in January from the disoriented data below, you can use the above formula as shown below. =SUMIF(C6:C11, ” Jan”, E6:E11) In this example, our range is C6:C11, and our criteria is “Jan.” In this case, the sum_range would be E6:E11. This formula will return $20,000 because two salaries were paid in Jan. COUNTIF Formula The COUNTIF formula counts the number of cells that meet a specific criterion. The syntax for the formula is as follows: =COUNTIF(range, criteria) For example, assume that you are comparing loan amounts from two different spreadsheets during one of the reconciliation works for a mortgage lending firm. The data is as below: Now you must check whether the loan amounts from both spreadsheets reconcile. This can be done with a simple formula of =C5=D5. This will compare both values and give a TRUE result if values are the same and FALSE if values are different in column E. The final step is using the COUNTIF formula, which will summarize how many value comparisons return FALSE. In cell E3, typing the following formula will give you a count of all the cells with FALSE as the value. =COUNTIF(E5:E12, “FALSE”) Since the significance of reconciliation is to highlight discrepancies in the data, such simple formulas make the task a lot easier. 4. PMT and IPMT These two Excel formulas are used to calculate the payment on an installment loan. The PMT formula calculates the monthly payment, while the IPMT formula calculates the interest payment. The difference between these two formulas is that the PMT formula calculates payments for a loan with constant interest rates. In contrast, the IPMT formula calculates payments for a loan with interest rates that change over time. The syntax for PMT function is as follows. =PMT(rate, nper, pv, [fv], [type]) where, rate = interest rate for the loan nper = number of payments for the loan pv = present value of the loan fv = future value of the loan. (Optional parameter) type = indicates whether the payments are made in the beginning (type = 1) or end of the period (type = 0). (Optional parameter) To use either of these formulas, you will need to input three pieces of information: Principle, Rate, and Number of Payments. To find out how much your monthly payment would be on a $20,000 car at a 6% annual rate with a tenure of 5 years (60 monthly payments), you would enter the formula in a cell and get a result of $386.66. =PMT(D5/12, D6, D4) Since it’s an annual rate, we need to divide it by 12 for monthly installments. Similarly, if we are paying the loan weekly, the same formula could be rewritten as shown below, and we will get $89.08 as the weekly payment on the loan. =PMT(D5/52, D6*52, D4) Suppose you have another loan of $20,000 for a car with a 12% rate that can be paid in a single year, i.e., in 12 monthly payments. What if you need to find how much interest you paid in the fifth month out of the total installment amount? You can use the IPMT function that will return you the interest paid in period ‘n.’ But first, you need to calculate PMT, which would be $1,776.98 in this case, using the below formula. =PMT(D5, D6, -C4) The syntax for IPMT function is: =IPMT(rate, per, nper, pv, [fv], [type]) where, rate = interest rate for the loan per = number of payments over which interest needs to be calculated nper = number of payments on the loan pv = present value of the loan fv = future value of the loan. It is an optional parameter. type = indicates whether the payments are made at the beginning (type = 1) or the end of the period (type = 0). It is also an optional parameter. Using the following formula will give $135.97 as the interest amount of the installment, while the rest is the principal amount ($1,776.98 - $135.97 = $1,641.01). =IPMT(C5/12, 5, C6*12, -C4) We have calculated the interest amount due for each month in the below table for your reference. 3. LEN and TRIM LEN() and TRIM() are two Excel formulas that you’ll find yourself using more often than others. LEN(), also known as the length function, returns the length of a text argument by calculating the number of characters in the string. TRIM() is used to remove any leading or trailing spaces from a text argument except for a single space between words. For example, assume that your data set has the following value in a cell. “John Doe 123 Main Street ABC corp” It has a lot of irregular spacing, making the data inconsistent with the other related fields and complicating the analysis. We can use the TRIM() function to remove the unnecessary spaces between text in cell C5. By using the simple formula TRIM(“C5”), you will get the result as “John Doe 123 Main Street ABC corp” and LEN(“D5”) will return 33. In short, if you want to know how many characters are in a text string, use LEN, and if you need to know what is between two words with spaces, use TRIM. 2. CONCATENATE The CONCATENATE function is a powerful function that will combine two strings of text, or two cells in a spreadsheet, into one. This formula can be used when you have a list of people’s names and need to create a column with their full names. Simply type the names in separate cells and use this formula to combine them! For example, let’s consider the first and last names below and combine them into their full name. Below is the syntax for the CONCATENATE function. =CONCATENATE(text1, [text2]...) We will be using this formula with specific parameters given below to join the first and last name in column E. =CONCATENATE(C4, “ ”, D4) Do you notice we have used quotation marks with a space (“ ”) in between them in the formula? It is to produce the space between the two names without which we would get our result as “JohnMcqueen.” You can also use the &(ampersand) character to combine text from different cells to generate similar results. Below is the formula to concatenate strings using the ampersand character. =C4&“ ”&D4 It is a matter of personal choice whether the analyst uses =CONCATENATE or the ampersand to join strings. 1. CELL, LEFT, MID, and RIGHT functions The CELL function will provide you with information about a cell in Excel. The LEFT, MID, and RIGHT functions will extract characters from a text string. The LEFT function discards everything to the left of the first character. In contrast, the MID function takes everything between the beginning and the end, ignoring spaces between words, and the RIGHT function discards everything to the right of the last character. For example, assume that you have the value “John Doe 123 Main Street ABC corp.” in an unknown cell in Excel. To determine the cell address, we will use the below formula with “address” as the info type parameter to return the cell's address. =CELL(“address”, C5) Similarly, you can use different parameters to find information related to the cell. Using LEFT, RIGHT, and MID() functions, we can extract characters out of one cell and into another cell. The num_chars is an optional parameter in the syntax for all three functions that determine the number of characters to be extracted from the selected text. Using a combination including these three functions, you can extract data from an entire column or row in Excel without using many different formulas. For example, if you want to get every person’s first name in your spreadsheet, type the following in cell E6 and copy it down till E10 to separate the last names from the full names in column C. =LEFT(C6, FIND(“ ”, C6)) Important things to remember A formula begins with the equal sign (=), without which any input function/formula will be represented as text in our spreadsheet. A space counts as a single character and must be considered while using functions such as MID, LEFT, RIGHT, and TRIM. Text values in formulas should be given inside quotation marks (“ ”). Else, the formulas won’t give you the correct value or show you an error. Try Excel practice exercises with some of these formulas here.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Jamie. Jamie Iannone President and Chief Executive Officer at eBay Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2022 was a year of consistent execution for eBay, as we made significant progress against our long-term objectives. Our focused categories drove underlying growth in our business, as we expanded global coverage for our 16 million enthusiast buyers. In Motors Parts and Accessories or P&A growth accelerated as we improved our fitment capabilities, increased supply of OEM parts, and enhanced trust signals for buyers. We extended authentication to new categories like trading cards and fine jewelry, and opened authentication centers in several new countries for handbags. We opened the vault to store and individually transact valuable items, and adoption has grown steadily week over week. We retired legacy technology, simplified the architecture of our core services, and improved our tech velocity. Our advertising growth accelerated as we scaled our three newer Promoted Listings products, optimized performance, and automated more elements of campaigns. We expanded our financial services portfolio by adding FX conversions, new forms of payments like Klarna and Afterpay, faster debit card payouts, and a digital wallet. And we balanced our investments in innovation with prudent cost discipline to establish a strong foundation for sustainable profitable growth for many years to come. Now turning to the fourth quarter. We delivered solid results in Q4 as our key financial metrics came in ahead of expectations, despite the ongoing macro uncertainty. We generated over $18 billion in GMV, and more than $2.5 billion in revenue. We delivered an operating margin of close to 30% while making critical investments in product and marketing to support our long-term growth strategy. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $1.07, up 2% year-over-year. Our focus category strategy was a major component of our strong financial performance during the fourth quarter. Focus categories grew more than 7 points faster than the rest of our marketplace during Q4, which was 2 points faster than the prior quarter. Establishing a game-changing level of trust between sellers and buyers has been an important driver of the momentum in our focus categories. Authenticity Guarantee enables trust in our luxury categories like watches, sneakers, handbags, and fine jewelry. We have observed notable turnarounds in GMV growth since we launched authentication, improved the product experience, and grew awareness to the great inventory in these categories. In aggregate, our luxury-focused categories have grown at roughly double-digit CAGR since Q4 of 2019, proving these investments have been highly effective. We dramatically improved trust in our refurbished offering by introducing warranties, and half of re-returns, which attracted more brands and new categories to our marketplace. Those investments paid dividends in Q4, with positive year-over-year GMV growth, and the biggest sales week ever for refurbished goods during Cyber Week. Trust in our Motors Parts and Accessories category is most reliant on fitment, for ensuring the compatibility of auto parts with a specific vehicle. During the last few months, we have taken major steps forward with our fitment capabilities. We acquired myFitment in Q3, to help sellers populate their listings with accurate fitment data, which ensures compatibility for buyers. In Q4, we began making myFitment's technology accessible to all buyers, starting with a pilot group of P&A sellers. Listings enhanced by this technology are seeing a measurable uplift in conversion, and we will expand this program further in 2023. Our significant investments in fitment over the past few years allowed us to launch a prominent Fit Your Vehicle badge in Q4. Similar to the Authenticity Guaranteed logo we show on luxury goods, this badge provides a clear indication of which parts fits your vehicle throughout the buyer journey across search, merchandising, view item, and checkout. This is no small feat with over 500 million active P&A listings on eBay, and the increasing complexity of vehicles in the marketplace. These advancements have significantly elevated our capabilities for P&A shoppers, and I'm pleased to share a new program we launched just last week called eBay Guaranteed Fit. This program is the breakthrough for trust and P&A that Authenticity Guarantee is in luxury, and warranties are for eBay Refurbished. It provides buyers with assurance that eBay will stand behind them, if a part doesn't fit their vehicle. Guaranteed Fit is a huge milestone for the P&A category, and the culmination of our multi-year fitment journey. I'm incredibly proud of our teams for executing the foundational work, making this program possible, and I'm looking forward to seeing their continued innovation in the category. I'm also excited about our team's work in collectibles, which has benefited from a steady cadence of product development and partnerships, including most recently, our live commerce beta. During Q4, we scaled up a number of eBay live events with select sellers, bringing healthy level of viewers, engagement, and GMV to participating sellers. We also introduced the eBay Live Hub, where users can subscribe to channels, and receive notifications about future events. This hub will serve as a central discovery point as we broaden the availability of live commerce to more sellers and categories this year. Our acquisition of TCGplayer has also greatly enhanced our collectibles category, and in Q4, we began developing synergies between our respective marketplaces. In addition to its customer base of nearly 800,000 hobbyists, a major competitive advantage for TCGplayer is its relationship with thousands of local brick-and-mortar hobby shops with many subscribing to its point of sale and channel management solution. Due to this software, sellers can now more easily streamline listings and inventory, on both TCGplayer and eBay. TCGplayer also further diversified its marketplace by introducing Comex [Phonetic] during Q4, which is a natural adjacency to collectible card games. eBay's historical sales data enabled TCGplayer to launch Comex [Phonetic] with robust pricing intelligence, which will help us scale this offering. While our integration is in its early days, I'm incredibly excited to see what TCGplayer community will bring to eBay over time. One of the key pillars of our strategy is being the platform of choice for sellers. eBay's scale and global footprint represent key advantages for our platform as we work toward achieving this vision. In 2022, roughly one-fifth of our GMV was facilitated through cross-border trade. Sellers who activate their listings internationally can reach buyers in over 200 countries globally. However, less than half of the inventory in our Top 3 markets is currently available for export, due to the friction associated with these transactions. To unlock more valuable inventory for global buyers, last fall, we announced a major revamp of our cross-border capabilities with the launch of eBay International Shipping. Under this program, eBay handles any customs forms, coordinates duties with buyers, and intermediates returns. Sellers are protected from item not received complaints, while buyers benefit from greater selection and lower shipping costs. The program is resonating well, as we gradually ramp enrollment for sellers, while buyer satisfaction on eBay international shipping transactions reached 80%. Steve will discuss the financial implications of this program, and I'm confident it will increase cross-border inventory and drive incremental GMV for eBay. Investments in AI are also improving customer perception of our shipping capabilities. In Q4, we deployed a new machine learning model for estimated delivery date in the U.S. and select international markets, enabling us to make more accurate delivery predictions to buyers. Applying this model in the U.S. reduced the average delivery estimate by 1.5 days for all domestic listings, resulting in a noticeable uplift in conversion. A separate model deployed for eligible Authenticity Guarantee products resulted in an average reduction of approximately two days for U.S. listings. These rollouts are just the latest example of our ability to leverage AI to make our existing processes more efficient, which will be a continued focus for us in 2023 and beyond. Moving on to ads. Our marketplace continues to benefit from innovation in our advertising business, which delivered strong growth in Q4, despite headwinds in the broader digital ad market. Promoted Listings drove first-party ad revenue of $276 million, up 27% or more than 30 points faster than GMV growth. Over 2 million sellers adopted a single ad product in Q4, and we eclipsed $700 million live Promoted Listings. Additionally, our total ad revenue is nearing 1.8% penetration of GMV. Promoted Listing Standard was again the largest contributor to growth, both on a sequential and an annual basis as optimization gains from prior quarters continued to benefit ad rates. In Q4, we also improved our merchandising algorithms to show a greater diversity of products, which improves buyer satisfaction, while also preserving relevance and conversion. Our newer ad products also continued to scale nicely in Q4, and grew more than 20% quarter-over-quarter. Promoted Listings Advanced, our cost per click product, continues to be a standout among the new products. Seller adoption of Advanced has grown as we have expanded access and automated more elements of campaign management, to make this powerful ad unit easier to use. In Q4, we launched Quick Setup, a one-click campaign creation solution for sellers, where eBay automates and optimizes the campaign structure, ad groups, targeting, and keyword bids for CPC advertisers. We also introduced multi-user account access across our full suite of Promoted Listings, which enables eBay sellers to delegate campaign management, to trusted third parties like brands or ad agencies. Turning to payments. We continue to roll out additional payment services to support high ASP transactions and improve buyer conversion. During Q4, we introduced split payments in the U.S. for transactions over $1,000, enabling buyers to spread large purchases across two credit cards. We've already processed transactions from thousands of buyers, at an average order value of over $3,000, and we're excited to expand this offering globally later this year, to better support our focus categories. Additionally, building on the success of Afterpay, we recently partnered with Zip to introduce a suite of buy now, pay later options to our Australian buyers. Zip supports purchases of up to $10,000, extending our ASP coverage in this valuable market. By managing our end-to-end payments process, we are also able to leverage our own proprietary risk models to assess transaction requests across our marketplace. Last year, our risk and protections team, with our enhanced controls that allowed us to approve transactions that may have otherwise been declined in the past, enabling over $0.5 billion of annualized GMV, and reducing potential escalations to customer service. In connection with risk management, we continue to invest in the security of our marketplace to ensure our capabilities remain world-class. Last week, we announced the acquisition of 3PM Shield, a provider of state-of-the-art marketplace compliance tool. 3PM Shield offers effective solutions for the prevention, and identification of counterfeit listings and prohibited items. Combining this technology with our proprietary data, will further enhance the integrity of our marketplace. Before we move on, I'd like to touch on the actions we've taken to sharpen our focus as a company and run our business more efficiently, particularly in light of the uncertain economic environment. Earlier this month, we made the difficult decision to eliminate approximately 500 jobs, or roughly 4% of our global employee base. This decision followed a thoughtful review of our organization to ensure our people and roles were aligned with priorities, that advance eBay's commitment to long-term sustainable growth. These changes provide additional flexibility for us to invest efficiently and create new roles in high potential areas of our business, like new technologies, trusted customer experiences, and key markets. There is no easy way to say goodbye to our talented colleagues. Their passion and accomplishments over the last few years have helped us get us to where we are today. We are incredibly thankful for their contributions, and are committed to supporting them through this difficult transition. Next, I'd like to share a few milestones from our ESG efforts last year, starting with recommerce. In 2022, our marketplace generated $4.6 billion in positive economic impact through the sale of pre-loved and refurbished goods. This activity avoided 1.6 million metric tons of carbon emissions and kept 73,000 metric tons of waste from going into landfills. Recommerce continues to provide significant economic benefit for sellers and buyers during these uncertain times, and buying pre-loved items shows no sign of slowing down. In fact, just yesterday, we published our third annual Recommerce Report, which found that 90% of surveyed respondents engaged in recommerce during 2022. Cost savings were the most popular motivator for buying pre-loved, especially among Gen Z buyers. 64% of whom said its financial savings as a primary reason for shopping recommerce and sustainability was the second most important factor, with people increasingly turning to pre-loved to help the environment. This positions us well as we continue to pave the way as an industry leader, enabling economic empowerment and sustainability through our platform. Now, let's turn to impact. I'm always amazed by the tremendous generosity of the eBay community. In Q4, eBay for Charity enabled sellers and buyers to raise more than $35 million. And for the year, customers raised over $163 million. This represents an all-time high in fund raised through eBay for Charity, since we started this program 20 years ago. The eBay Foundation granted nearly $23 million in 2022, primarily to non-profit organizations, advancing inclusive entrepreneurship, and through our employee matching gift programs. This represents another all-time high for annual foundation grants. I am fortunate to lead a purpose-driven company with a team dedicated to helping communities around the world, while protecting our planet. For the fourth year in a row, eBay was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World and North American indices. We were also included on CDP's A List for 2022, which recognizes companies that are leading the way in environmental transparency and performance on climate change. Additionally, eBay ranks Number 1 on Cross-Border Commerce Europe's list of the top sustainable marketplaces operating in Europe. Looking to 2023, I'm incredibly excited about the road map ahead of us. Today, I'll offer just a glimpse of a few areas where you should expect to see progress from us this year. We'll continue to innovate for customers in our focus categories, and extend to new countries and categories this year. We will continue our work in P&A, by expanding the guaranteed FIT program and Fit Your Vehicle badge globally. We'll also grow our tire installation capabilities, after we began improving the end-to-end tire shopping experience, and broaden our network of installation partners in five markets during Q4. We'll ramp assets in the vault, and extend eligibility for more collectible items. While integrations with TCG player and known Origin will strengthen our value proposition for collectors, we will also continue to iterate next-gen shopping features like live commerce, to better engage with enthusiasts, and we will further develop the category landing pages we debut for sneakers, watches, and handbags in Q4, which offer trending inventory and personalized recommendations, powered by machine learning. Sellers across our marketplace will benefit from the expansion of our international shipping program to more markets, which will drive incremental GMV, as sellers tap into our global demand. We will continue to scale our advertising offerings, as we track toward our next $1 billion by 2025, we'll simplify and grow adoption of float listings advance, deliver more AI-driven optimization, and further expand our ads portfolio. Finally, just as we have done in focus categories, this year we will adapt our one-size-fits-all approach, to build more relevant and compelling localized experiences, in some of our European markets. We will enhance local discoverability, reduce friction through simplified selling experiences, offer new local forms of payment, and address other market-specific experience gaps in search, language, and return policies. In closing, I would like to thank our extraordinary eBay employees for their accomplishments this year. Their unrelenting focus on serving our community has supported our sellers and buyers during these challenging economic times. I'm confident that with our talented eBay team, our strategic vision, and a persistent focus on operational excellence, we will continue to develop compelling experiences for customers, and create long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you. Steve Priest Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer at eBay Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with highlights from the fourth quarter on Slide 9 of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll review our key operating and financial metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the first quarter and some additional color on 2023, before we begin Q&A. As usual, my comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons on an FX-neutral basis, unless I note otherwise. We delivered solid results in Q4, as our key financial metrics exceeded expectations, and landed near the high end or above our expected guidance at ages [Phonetic]. Gross merchandise volume declined 6% to $18.2 billion, while FX was a 6-point headwind to reported growth. Revenue was down 1% to approximately $2.5 billion, which outpaced volume by 5 points, primarily due to FX and robust growth within our advertising business. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29.9%, down 1.8 points due to volume deleverage, and continued investment in marketing to support the strategic initiatives. We delivered $1.07 of non-GAAP earnings per share, up 2% year-over-year, and we generated $533 million of free cash flow, up 43% year-over-year, while returning $419 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Our Q4 results demonstrate the continued resilience of our marketplace, amid economic uncertainty. I'm extremely proud of our teams delivering on their quarterly financial commitments, maintaining prudent cost discipline, and executing key deliverables in support of our long-term growth objectives. Let's take a closer look at our financial performance during the fourth quarter. Gross merchandise volume is down 6% year-over-year, decelerating roughly 1 point sequentially. Our business remains resilient, despite headwinds from geopolitical uncertainty, inflationary pressures, low consumer confidence, and rising interest rates. Additionally, FX was a headwind of approximately 6 points of GMV, roughly 0.5 point greater than Q3. Momentum in focus categories continues to drive underlying growth in our business. In aggregate, focus categories outgrew the remainder of our marketplace by over 7 points year-over-year during Q4, roughly 2 points faster than the prior quarter delta. Motors Parts and Accessories growth accelerated sequentially, and remained the largest contributor to this outperformance. And we are excited to see what recent rollouts like Fit Your Vehicle badge and Guaranteed Fit program will do for momentum in this category. Refurbished goods also contributed positively to growth in Q4, as we continue to expand to new brands and categories. We've also made the onboarding process for third-party sellers more scalable, to increase the breadth and depth of refurbished selection on our marketplace. Within our luxury and trading cards categories, we continued to see healthy trends in authenticated item transactions in Q4, which has mitigated the macro-driven ASP pressure, observed across these industries, in recent months. As you'll recall, we closed the acquisition of TCGplayer at the end of October. A partial quarter of GMV, revenue, and expenses are included in our financials for Q4, but based on the timing of the deal close, TCGplayer's contribution is not material to results. Looking at our business on a geographic basis, our U.S. GMV declined 9% year-over-year in Q4, decelerating by roughly 2 points versus the prior quarter. International GMV declined 4% on an FX neutral basis, which was stable sequentially. Compared to Q4 of 2019, our total marketplace grew 2%, a deceleration from 6% last quarter. Versus 2019, U.S. GMV rose 12% in Q4, while international GMV was down 5%. Although macro headwinds remain more pronounced in Europe, our focus category strategy continued to drive underlying growth internationally, including positive year-over-year growth in P&A, and notable strength in luxury categories during Q4. Moving to active buyers. 134 million active buyers shopped on eBay during the trailing 12 months. We had 132 million active buyers, excluding our TCGplayer acquisition, and buyers from our Turkey business, where we ceased operations in July. Excluding these impacts, active buyers were down roughly 1 million sequentially, as a gradual improvement in buyer reactivation over the past few quarters has led to modest stabilization in our active buyer counts. Enthusiast buyers accounted for over 16 million of our active buyers in Q4, down less than 0.5 million sequentially, and churn within enthusiasts remains de minimis. The net downward migration of enthusiasts to the mid-value group was also the lowest we observed, since we began disclosing these buyer groups as lapping pressure has eased in recent quarters. Average spend per enthusiast rose again sequentially, and continued to be healthy at above $3,000 annually. Turning to revenue. You'll notice in our Q4 earnings release, and upcoming 10-K that we are now presenting a single net revenues line, which better aligns our reporting with how our business is operated. We provided one final quarter of marketing services and other revenue in Slide 12 of our earnings presentation. Today, and moving forward, when we refer to take rate, we will be referencing our all-in net revenue, divided by GMV. Net revenue was down 1% to over $2.5 billion during the fourth quarter, 1 point acceleration versus Q3. Our take rate was 13.8% in Q4, up [Phonetic] roughly 40 basis points sequentially. Although FX hedge gains were the most significant driver of our sequential take rate increase in Q4, we continue to see healthy contributions in both advertising and payments revenue. Our advertising business continues to build momentum. Total ad revenue grew 19% during the quarter, while first-party ads grew 27%, outpacing volume by more than 30 points for the second straight quarter. This extraordinary result was primarily driven by optimization and performance improvements in our standard promoted listings product. Healthy growth in our newer products, most notably our cost per click ads, also contributed meaningfully. Our legacy third-party display ads were weaker in Q4, due to industry-wide headwinds over the holidays, but these ads represent an increasingly smaller portion of our mix. Managed payments contributed nearly 10 basis points to our sequential take rate expansion, driven by new financial service offerings. These include buyer and seller FX conversions, that facilitates cross-border trade, faster debit card payouts, and new [Indecipherable] transaction services, supporting our luxury categories. Importantly, both advertising and payments remain on track to meet our multiyear revenue targets, we discussed at our Investor Day. Moving to profitability, non-GAAP operating margin was 29.9% in Q4, up nearly 1 point sequentially, but down 1.8 points year-over-year. Gross margins were down modestly year-over-year due to volume deleverage, and authentication costs, partly offset by lower payment processing fees. Sales and marketing rose by over 1 point as a percentage of revenue, as we invested in full funnel marketing, to support our focused categories, while product development was relatively flat as some one-time impacts offset continued hiring of technical talent. Our G&A expense rose as a percentage of revenue, due to charitable contributions, and other one-time items. In Q4, we recognized a GAAP charge within G&A expense of $50 million related to pending legal matters. You'll see these adjustments included in our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations, in the appendix of our earnings presentation. Additional details on this accrual will be provided in our upcoming Form 10-K. We generated $1.07 of non-GAAP earnings per share in Q4, up 2% year-over-year, benefiting from a 12% reduction in share count, from our share repurchases. We delivered GAAP earnings per share of $1.23, with the delta being driven by a recovery in our equity investment portfolio. Turning to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Free cash flow grew 43% to $533 million in Q4, driven primarily by the lapping of cash tax payments on investment sales in the prior year. Our balance sheet position remains strong, as we ended the quarter with cash and non-equity investments of $5.9 billion, and gross debt of $8.9 billion, following a successful $1.2 billion debt raise in November. We repurchased roughly $300 million of shares, at an average price of approximately $42 during Q4, and have over $2.8 billion remaining under our current authorization. We paid a quarterly cash dividend of $119 million in December, or $0.22 per share. Our investment portfolio is detailed on Slide 20 of our earnings presentation. Our equity investments were valued at approximately $3.4 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. Following the sale of a de minimis number of shares in December, to satisfy regulatory requirements, our 404 million Adevinta shares were valued at roughly $2.7 billion. Our Adyen investment value is calculated based on the probability of our remaining warrant tranche investing. In addition to the acquisitions we completed in 2022, we continued to evaluate inorganic opportunities to accelerate our strategic objectives via our Build By Partner framework. We closed the acquisition of 3PM Shield last week, which will strengthen trust in our marketplace by helping us prevent and detect problematic listings with even greater precision. Moving on to our outlook. For the first quarter, we forecast GMV between $18 billion and $18.3 billion, representing organic FX neutral growth between negative 5%, and negative 4% year-over-year. This GMV outlook includes an estimated $100 million from one-time benefits already recognized in Q1, and anticipates an FX headwind to reported growth between 2 points and 3 points. We expect to generate revenue between $2.46 billion and $2.5 billion, representing organic FX neutral growth between flat and up 2% year-over-year. We anticipate a non-GAAP operating margin between 29.1% and 29.7%, and we forecast non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.05 and $1.09, representing EPS growth between flat and up 3% year-over-year. Although, we are not providing full-year guidance at this time, given the dynamic operating environment, we will share some directional color on how we are currently thinking about 2023. Our baseline expectation is that the external demand environment does not materially improve during the first half of the year, as a result of continued macro uncertainty across our largest markets. While we do see potential for an improvement in underlying economic conditions as the year progresses, it is too early to predict the second half recovery, firing out with confidence. As a result, we currently expect our sequential GMV growth beyond Q1 to roughly approximate the seasonality we observed during 2022, excluding the impact of currency. For the full year, we expect to grow total non-GAAP expenses, inclusive of cost of revenue by approximately 2% year-over-year on a spot basis, as we continue to invest in strategic growth initiatives in 2023. This forecast contemplates one-time impacts to our P&L, from recent M&A and the rollout of the eBay International Shipping program this year. These one-time factors combined are expected to represent a year-over-year headwind for operating margin of approximately 120 basis points versus 2022. Our expense growth forecast is also net of roughly $100 million of opex savings, from our structural cost program, as we continue to look inward for cost efficiencies in our business. I'd like to share some additional context on the one-time impact to margin. Over the past year, we accelerated our progress towards several core strategic objectives, through the acquisitions of TCGplayer, KnownOrigin, myFitment, and 3PM Shield. While we are excited about the synergies and long-term growth potential of these assets, layering them into a scale of the marketplace with our level of profitability does present a natural drag on margins in the short term, which will diminish, as our integration work progresses. The rollout of eBay International Shipping will improve seller velocity, and global availability of unique inventory over the long run. Our role in intermediating shipping and returns in this program, will shift us to a principal relationship with sellers, versus being an agency in our previous global shipping program. From an accounting perspective, this means revenue from the new program will be recognized on a gross basis, while the vast majority of expenses are variable, and recognize the cost of revenue. While the operating margin headwind from this program will abate as we progressively scale it through 2023, it's primarily variable costs or impact to our reported gross margins. We expect this program to generate incremental operating profit this year, despite representing a headwind of 30 basis points of gross margin in Q1, rising to 120 basis points in Q4. Additionally, we expect foreign exchange to represent a headwind of approximately 1% of GMV in 2023, and between 3% to 4% to non-GAAP EPS, following the unwinding of recent U.S. dollar strength. We forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 16.5% throughout 2023. On the capital allocation front, I'm pleased to announce our Board recently approved a 14% increase to our quarterly dividend, raising to $0.25 per share in 2023. We continue to target returning approximately 125% of free cash flow to shareholders, between 2022 and 2024, and our broader capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Our fortress balance sheet is a tremendous competitive advantage in this environment that enables us to invest organically in our business, accelerate our strategic objectives with disciplined inorganic investments, while still delivering healthy capital return to shareholders. In the current macro environment, we believe it is prudent to balance the timing and magnitude of share repurchases with our capital needs from quarter-to-quarter. Our first priority is offsetting dilution, and we expect to be opportunistic with regard to larger repurchases. In closing, our Q4 results capped off a resilient year for eBay in 2022, as we made meaningful progress towards our long-term strategy, despite significant macro uncertainty. We exceeded consensus expectations for GMV, revenue, and EPS during Q4. Our focus categories continued to outperform, and are driving underlying growth in our business. Our advertising revenue continues to meaningfully outpace volume growth, while payment initiatives continued to scale in line with expectations. We achieved a full year operating margin of 30%, despite contending with a more challenging macro environment than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. We generated nearly $2.2 billion in free cash flow in 2022 and returned over $3.6 billion to shareholders through repurchases, and dividends, equating to nearly 170% of our free cash flow. I'm proud that eBay continues to pave the way as an industry leader, enabling economic empowerment, and sustainability to our platform. We once again achieved carbon neutrality in 2022, and remain committed to reducing 90% of our carbon emissions from our operations by 2030. I'm incredibly appreciative of our team's focus and execution during 2022, as we delivered on a number of our core strategic objectives, despite navigating uncertain macro environment. I'm confident our investments in 2022 enabled us to exit the year stronger than when we entered it, keeping us on a path to sustainable long-term growth. With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions."

Two civilians killed in Russian attack on Zaporizhzhia: Ukraine officials Women who work at a Russian e-commerce company that has been compared to Amazon and eBay must undergo humiliating strip searches at the entrance to their offices, according to newly surfaced video. The clip leaked purportedly shows the women undress before they are forced to line up and go through a security checkpoint manned by female scanners at the entrance to the St. Petersburg offices of Wildberries, the tech firm that runs the country’s largest online retailer. According to Russian media, the searches are done in order to prevent employees from carrying phones or watches into the workspace as well as to crack down on theft. “Workers, under the supervision of video cameras, undress and go to the inspection point,” said a report. Men are also apparently subjected to the humiliating searches, according to Russian news agencies.

Ratings come from analysts, or specialists within banking and financial systems that report for specific stocks or defined sectors (typically once per quarter for each stock). Analysts usually derive their information from company conference calls and meetings, financial statements, and conversations with important insiders to reach their decisions. Some analysts publish their predictions for metrics such as growth estimates, earnings, and revenue to provide additional guidance with their ratings. When using analyst ratings, it is important to keep in mind that stock and sector analysts are also human and are only offering their opinions to investors.

ENPH is scheduled to report its first-quarter 2023 results on Apr 25 after the closing bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 18.90%. Enphase Energy has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 19.47%, on average. Factors to Note Strong sales growth for microinverters in the United States and Europe is likely to have boosted Enphase’s overall sales performance in the first quarter of 2023. In Europe, the strong demand for the company’s microinverters in the Netherlands, France, Germany, Belgium, Spain and Portugal and the U.K. might have contributed to ENPH’s revenues in the first quarter of 2023. Also, the introduction of its highly acclaimed IQ8 microinverters in parts of Europe may have added impetus to revenues from the European region, contributing to the overall top line in the first quarter of 2023. Latin America is expected to have continued to deliver strength in sales, which is likely to have added impetus to revenues in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Other regions like Australia, Brazil and India are also expected to have contributed favorably to the overall top line in the first quarter of 2023. However, sales performance in the United States is likely to have been unimpressive, mainly due to seasonality and the macroeconomic environment. This may have a partial impact on the revenues of the company in the first quarter of 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $721.7 million, suggesting growth of 63.6% from the year-ago quarter.

Specifically, green incentives are fueling a boom in residential solar power installations. As this trend matures, it will provide increasing benefits to users, consumers, professionals, and investors. But we’ll be talking here about residential solar installations. These home power units are seeing solid interest from consumers, based in part on a variety of ‘green’ pressures and in part on increases in electric utility bills. From an investor’s perspective, the key here is module-level power electronics, MLPE, a new take on the microinverter technology that is essential to making small-scale solar installations function. Writing from banking firm HSBC, analyst Daniel Yang sets out the case for residential solar stocks – and how they’ll gain from MLPE tech. “The new trend in the global solar inverter market is the rise of premium inverters – known as module-level power electronics (MLPE). They cost more but are safer and create more output. They already dominate the US market and we expect them to increasingly be used in the rest of the world… We think this is an overlooked opportunity by investors in MLPE providers,” Yang opined. Yang doesn’t leave us with a macro view of the industry. The analyst goes on to give a drill-down to the micro level, and picks out two solar stocks that stand to benefit from the rise of MLPE. Are other Wall Street analysts in agreement here? We dived into TipRanks, the world’s biggest database of analysts and research, to pull up the details and find out. SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) We’ll start with SolarEdge Technologies, a player in the design and manufacture of microinverters. As mentioned previously, microinverters are an essential piece of solar installation technology. Specifically, microinverters change the DC (direct current) power produced by photovoltaic panels into AC (alternating current) energy that can be used in modern electric power systems. Story continues In addition to microinverters, SolarEdge also produces photovoltaic monitoring systems, power optimizers, and even solar-powered EV chargers. The company markets its products directly to consumers in the residential market, to building owners and businesses in the commercial installation market, and to construction and other installation professionals. While SolarEdge is well known for its high-end microinverters, it’s power optimizer products actually have a larger market share. The company is moving toward a more MLPE-based technology on all of its product lines, to gain leverage from the rapid growth of this tech in the solar installation niche. For SolarEdge, this adds up to plenty of opportunity to grow revenue and earnings. The company’s top line has shown consistent quarter-over-quarter sequential increases in the last several years, and in its last report, for 4Q22, SolarEdge beat expectations on both revenues and earnings. At the top line, the $890.7 million reported was $11.6 million above the forecast, and up 61% year-over-year. The bottom line non-GAAP EPS figure of $2.86 came in an impressive $1.27 better than forecast, and represented a massive increase from the mere 74 cent EPS recorded in the prior-year quarter. So this is a company on the rise, with a solid position in the US solar installation market. That market was estimated at more than $14 billion in 2022, and is expected to see a CAGR of 15% going out to 2030. With all of this in the background behind, we can see the optimism in Daniel Yang’s comments on the company: “SolarEdge has an 87% global market share in optimisers, devices used to maximise the solar energy output of a solar system. In our view, this is due to its proprietary technology in chip design and algorithms. MLPE’s market share in the US distributed generation (DG) solar market has grown from zero to nearly 100% in the past decade. SolarEdge is one of the leaders in the US market and we expect Europe to be the next growth driver, where we forecast that MLPE adoption will increase from 24% in 2021 to 50% by 2025e.” Looking forward, it’s no wonder that Yang rates this stock a Buy, and his price target, at $418, implies a one-year upside potential of 31%. (To watch Yang’s track record, click here) What other analysts have to say about SolarEdge? The stock gets a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 23 recent analyst reviews that include 17 Buys against 6 Holds. The stock is trading for $319.20 and its $375.18 average price target suggests it will grow 17.5% from current levels. (See SolarEdge stock forecast) Enphase Energy (ENPH) The second stock we’ll turn to is Enphase Energy, the current market leader in overall solar MLPE installations. The company’s chief product line consists of solar power inverters, and Enphase’s leading position is based on its ability to bring commercial-scale inverters directly to the market. Enphase is the dominant player in the US residential solar market, boasting an impressive market share of 86%. Enphase has rested on its power inverters, however. The company also produces energy storage systems, another technology essential in making residential and small commercial solar installations viable for customers. The company incorporates smart tech into its line of IQ power storage batteries, allowing users finer control of power loads and the ability to set power distribution priorities among notoriously power-hungry appliances. Like SolarEdge above, one of its chief competitors, Enphase has seen solid and consistent gains at both the top and bottom lines in recent quarters. The company’s 4Q22 results featured solid revenue gains, with the company reported $724.65 million in total sales, up 75% year-over-year and $21.5 million better than had been expected. The non-GAAP quarterly EPS was set at $1.51, or 25 cents better than the forecast. Enphase brought in $237.3 million in free cash flow for the quarter, and finished 2022 with $1.61 billion in cash and other liquid assets on hand. With a background like that, it’s no wonder that ENPH has attracted rave reviews from HSBC’s Daniel Yang. The analyst rates the stock a Buy, along with a $271 price target, which implies a 21% upside from current levels. (To watch Yang’s track record, click here) Backing his stance, Yang writes: “Enphase grew its share of the US residential solar inverter market from less than 20% in 2019 to around 45% in 2020…. we believe another reason for the company’s success is a differentiated value proposition for customers, led by compressive and one-stop product offerings; enhanced software solutions that improve the user experience; a strong focus on smaller installers in a fragmented market. These strengths have not only helped the company to gain share in the US market but also convinced customers to pay premium prices for products and services.” Zooming out, we find that Enphase get a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street’s analysts, based on 22 reviews that break down to 19 Buys and 3 Holds. The shares have an average price target of $287.24, suggesting a 28% one-year increase from the current trading price of $223.61.

ENPH moved higher by 8.16%. When understanding a companies price change over a time period like 3 months, it could be helpful to look at its financials. One key aspect of a companies financials is its debt, but before we understand the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Enphase Energy has. Enphase Energy Debt Based on Enphase Energy's financial statement as of February 13, 2023, long-term debt is at $1.20 billion and current debt is at $90.89 million, amounting to $1.29 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $473.24 million in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $817.11 million. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents includes cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering Enphase Energy's $3.08 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.42. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than 1 indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry, but average for another. Why Investors Look At Debt? Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital. However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations. Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

(AP) — FREMONT, Calif. (AP) — Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) on Tuesday reported first-quarter net income of $146.9 million. On a per-share basis, the Fremont, California-based company said it had profit of $1.02. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were $1.37 per share. The results beat Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $1.21 per share. The solar technology company posted revenue of $726 million in the period, which also topped Street forecasts. Twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $723.4 million. For the current quarter ending in June, Enphase Energy said it expects revenue in the range of $700 million to $750 million. _____ This story was generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.

NASDAQ: ENPH stock is down 16% in after-hours trading after concerns about softening revenue in the next quarter. On a day when investors were reminded that the banking crisis is still festering in the background, any bad news was going to be punished. However, as difficult as this may feel for investors who bought around the March low, this looks like an opportunity for patient investors with a long time horizon. Of course, one of the difficult things for any investor to do is to be patient. The pullback has sent ENPH stock near its $183.64 closing price on March 17, 2023. At that time, the stock was down approximately 45% from its 52-week high set in December. Investors who “bought the dip” in the stock may be wishing they took some profit off the table. Get Enphase Energy alerts: A Split Decision The company’s first quarter earnings report was mostly positive. The company reported earnings per share of $1.37. That handily beat analysts’ expectations of $1.20 EPS. On the top line, it was more of a mixed bag. Sales of $762 million was 1% below analysts’ expectations of $732.30 million. However, it was 64% higher than the $441 million the company recorded in the same quarter in 2022. Enphase also reported an increase in its gross margin. The miss in revenue occurred because a 9% year-over-year miss in the United States (the company’s largest market) was not enough to offset strong growth in Europe. Also, the company is now forecasting second quarter revenue to be in a range of $700 million to $750 million. Analysts were expecting $772.96 million. Enphase attributes the softer revenue in the upcoming quarter to U.S. distributors needing to work through a backlog of inventory. Any decline in sales in the company's largest market should be taken seriously. But the company said that its European business is showing strong growth. And the company is also seeing growth in other international markets. What Could Go Wrong? The company's forecast for the United States is based on expectations that the backlog in inventory will work itself through in the next quarter or two. But suppose the long-awaited recession arrives sometime later this year as expected. In that case, consumers will be hesitant to invest in solar regardless of any rebates being offered by the Biden administration.

There are also concerns that Enphase could suffer a production slip-up as it relies on a contract manufacturing facility in China. This is at a time when relations between the United States and China are increasingly strained. Accumulate the Dip? According to MarketBeat’s Enphase Energy analyst ratings, B. Riley increased its price target for ENPH stock to $247 from $242 immediately after the earnings report. That’s not a screaming endorsement but investors may get a better clue by looking at the Enphase Energy institutional ownership. Currently, approximately 73% of institutions own the stock. And there was more buying than selling in the first quarter. However, as the wicked price action shows, many investors have little patience for growth stocks. And that means there is a possibility for ENPH stock to fall further. But if you have patience and believe that the company is one of the best solar plays in the market, then now is a good time to start accumulating shares. There’s no need to go all in. But these are times to nibble on the stock as it gives investors another opportunity to get shares well below the target price of analysts. Should you invest $1,000 in Enphase Energy right now?

        "content": "Enphase Energy, Inc. ENPH is scheduled to report its first-quarter 2023 results on Apr 25 after the closing bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 18.90%. Enphase Energy has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 19.47%, on average. Factors to Note Strong sales growth for microinverters in the United States and Europe is likely to have boosted Enphase’s overall sales performance in the first quarter of 2023. In Europe, the strong demand for the company’s microinverters in the Netherlands, France, Germany, Belgium, Spain and Portugal and the U.K. might have contributed to ENPH’s revenues in the first quarter of 2023. Also, the introduction of its highly acclaimed IQ8 microinverters in parts of Europe may have added impetus to revenues from the European region, contributing to the overall top line in the first quarter of 2023. Latin America is expected to have continued to deliver strength in sales, which is likely to have added impetus to revenues in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Other regions like Australia, Brazil and India are also expected to have contributed favorably to the overall top line in the first quarter of 2023. However, sales performance in the United States is likely to have been unimpressive, mainly due to seasonality and the macroeconomic environment. This may have a partial impact on the revenues of the company in the first quarter of 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $721.7 million, suggesting growth of 63.6% from the year-ago quarter. A strong top line, aided by strength in the sale of its product range in different regions, is likely to have benefited the bottom line of Enphase Energy in the first quarter of 2023.

With all of this in the background behind, we can see the optimism in Daniel Yang’s comments on the company: “SolarEdge has an 87% global market share in optimisers, devices used to maximise the solar energy output of a solar system. In our view, this is due to its proprietary technology in chip design and algorithms. MLPE’s market share in the US distributed generation (DG) solar market has grown from zero to nearly 100% in the past decade. SolarEdge is one of the leaders in the US market and we expect Europe to be the next growth driver, where we forecast that MLPE adoption will increase from 24% in 2021 to 50% by 2025e.” Looking forward, it’s no wonder that Yang rates this stock a Buy, and his price target, at $418, implies a one-year upside potential of 31%. (To watch Yang’s track record, click here) What other analysts have to say about SolarEdge? The stock gets a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 23 recent analyst reviews that include 17 Buys against 6 Holds. The stock is trading for $319.20 and its $375.18 average price target suggests it will grow 17.5% from current levels. (See SolarEdge stock forecast) Enphase Energy (ENPH) The second stock we’ll turn to is Enphase Energy, the current market leader in overall solar MLPE installations. The company’s chief product line consists of solar power inverters, and Enphase’s leading position is based on its ability to bring commercial-scale inverters directly to the market. Enphase is the dominant player in the US residential solar market, boasting an impressive market share of 86%. Enphase has rested on its power inverters, however. The company also produces energy storage systems, another technology essential in making residential and small commercial solar installations viable for customers. The company incorporates smart tech into its line of IQ power storage batteries, allowing users finer control of power loads and the ability to set power distribution priorities among notoriously power-hungry appliances. Like SolarEdge above, one of its chief competitors, Enphase has seen solid and consistent gains at both the top and bottom lines in recent quarters. The company’s 4Q22 results featured solid revenue gains, with the company reported $724.65 million in total sales, up 75% year-over-year and $21.5 million better than had been expected. The non-GAAP quarterly EPS was set at $1.51, or 25 cents better than the forecast. Enphase brought in $237.3 million in free cash flow for the quarter, and finished 2022 with $1.61 billion in cash and other liquid assets on hand. With a background like that, it’s no wonder that ENPH has attracted rave reviews from HSBC’s Daniel Yang. The analyst rates the stock a Buy, along with a $271 price target, which implies a 21% upside from current levels. (To watch Yang’s track record, click here) Backing his stance, Yang writes: “Enphase grew its share of the US residential solar inverter market from less than 20% in 2019 to around 45% in 2020…. we believe another reason for the company’s success is a differentiated value proposition for customers, led by compressive and one-stop product offerings; enhanced software solutions that improve the user experience; a strong focus on smaller installers in a fragmented market. These strengths have not only helped the company to gain share in the US market but also convinced customers to pay premium prices for products and services.” Zooming out, we find that Enphase get a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street’s analysts, based on 22 reviews that break down to 19 Buys and 3 Holds. The shares have an average price target of $287.24, suggesting a 28% one-year increase from the current trading price of $223.61.

        "title": "Enphase Energy's Debt Overview",
        "content": "Over the past three months, shares of Enphase Energy Inc. ENPH moved higher by 8.16%. When understanding a companies price change over a time period like 3 months, it could be helpful to look at its financials. One key aspect of a companies financials is its debt, but before we understand the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Enphase Energy has. Enphase Energy Debt Based on Enphase Energy's financial statement as of February 13, 2023, long-term debt is at $1.20 billion and current debt is at $90.89 million, amounting to $1.29 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $473.24 million in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $817.11 million. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents includes cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering Enphase Energy's $3.08 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.42. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than 1 indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry, but average for another. Why Investors Look At Debt? Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital. However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations. Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

        "title": "Soft Guidance Shouldn’t Take the Shine Off Enphase Energy Stock",
        "content": "Enphase Energy, Inc. NASDAQ: ENPH stock is down 16% in after-hours trading after concerns about softening revenue in the next quarter. On a day when investors were reminded that the banking crisis is still festering in the background, any bad news was going to be punished. However, as difficult as this may feel for investors who bought around the March low, this looks like an opportunity for patient investors with a long time horizon. Of course, one of the difficult things for any investor to do is to be patient. The pullback has sent ENPH stock near its $183.64 closing price on March 17, 2023. At that time, the stock was down approximately 45% from its 52-week high set in December. Investors who “bought the dip” in the stock may be wishing they took some profit off the table. Get Enphase Energy alerts: A Split Decision The company’s first quarter earnings report was mostly positive. The company reported earnings per share of $1.37. That handily beat analysts’ expectations of $1.20 EPS. On the top line, it was more of a mixed bag. Sales of $762 million was 1% below analysts’ expectations of $732.30 million. However, it was 64% higher than the $441 million the company recorded in the same quarter in 2022. Enphase also reported an increase in its gross margin. The miss in revenue occurred because a 9% year-over-year miss in the United States (the company’s largest market) was not enough to offset strong growth in Europe. Also, the company is now forecasting second quarter revenue to be in a range of $700 million to $750 million. Analysts were expecting $772.96 million. Enphase attributes the softer revenue in the upcoming quarter to U.S. distributors needing to work through a backlog of inventory. Any decline in sales in the company's largest market should be taken seriously. But the company said that its European business is showing strong growth. And the company is also seeing growth in other international markets. What Could Go Wrong? The company's forecast for the United States is based on expectations that the backlog in inventory will work itself through in the next quarter or two. But suppose the long-awaited recession arrives sometime later this year as expected. In that case, consumers will be hesitant to invest in solar regardless of any rebates being offered by the Biden administration.

There are also concerns that Enphase could suffer a production slip-up as it relies on a contract manufacturing facility in China. This is at a time when relations between the United States and China are increasingly strained. Accumulate the Dip? According to MarketBeat’s Enphase Energy analyst ratings, B. Riley increased its price target for ENPH stock to $247 from $242 immediately after the earnings report. That’s not a screaming endorsement but investors may get a better clue by looking at the Enphase Energy institutional ownership. Currently, approximately 73% of institutions own the stock. And there was more buying than selling in the first quarter. However, as the wicked price action shows, many investors have little patience for growth stocks. And that means there is a possibility for ENPH stock to fall further. But if you have patience and believe that the company is one of the best solar plays in the market, then now is a good time to start accumulating shares. There’s no need to go all in. But these are times to nibble on the stock as it gives investors another opportunity to get shares well below the target price of analysts. Should you invest $1,000 in Enphase Energy right now?

(ENPH) is a Trending Stock\n内容: Enphase Energy (ENPH Quick QuoteENPH - Free Report) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock. Shares of this solar technology company have returned +8.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.6% change. The Zacks Solar industry, to which Enphase Energy belongs, has lost 14.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making. Revisions to Earnings Estimates Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, Enphase Energy is expected to post earnings of $1.02 per share, indicating a change of -18.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.9% over the last 30 days. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5 points to a change of +8.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.9%. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.29 indicates a change of +25.7% from what Enphase Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.6%. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Enphase Energy. The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: 12 Month EPS Projected Revenue Growth Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial. For Enphase Energy, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $564.92 million indicates a year-over-year change of -11%. For the current and next fiscal years, $2.64 billion and $2.96 billion estimates indicate +13.2% and +12.2% changes, respectively. Last Reported Results and Surprise History Enphase Energy reported revenues of $711.12 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +34.1%. EPS of $1.47 for the same period compares with $1.07 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $726.94 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.18%. The EPS surprise was +15.75%. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period. Valuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance. Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is. As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Enphase Energy is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. Bottom Line The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Enphase Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\n---\n\n[2023-10-19] 2023-10-19 14:01:00\n标题: Analysts Estimate Enphase Energy (ENPH) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for\n内容: Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Enphase Energy (ENPH) reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates. The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 26, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings call it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This solar technology company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.02 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -18.4%. Revenues are expected to be $566.21 million, down 10.8% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 9.87% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change. Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Enphase Energy? For Enphase Energy, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.71%. On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3. So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Enphase Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue? While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Enphase Energy would post earnings of $1.27 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.47, delivering a surprise of +15.75%. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times. Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Enphase Energy doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release. Expected Results of an Industry Player Among the stocks in the Zacks Solar industry, Sunnova Energy (NOVA) is soon expected to post loss of $0.29 per share for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +46.3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $199.55 million, up 33.6% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus EPS estimate for Sunnova Energy has been revised 7.3% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -27.99%. When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Sunnova Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.

While Enphase has lower exposure to Europe and done a better job derisking Q3 estimates, the company's near-term outlook is likely to fall well short of current consensus estimates. adamkaz/E+ via Getty Images After the close of Wednesday's regular session, leading solar string inverter manufacturer SolarEdge Technologies Inc. (SEDG) or \"SolarEdge\" surprised market participants with an ugly earnings warning (emphasis added by author): During the second part of the third quarter of 2023, we experienced substantial unexpected cancellations and pushouts of existing backlog from our European distributors,” said Zvi Lando, Chief Executive Officer of SolarEdge. “We attribute these cancellations and pushouts to higher than expected inventory in the channels and slower than expected installation rates. In particular, installation rates for the third quarter were much slower at the end of the summer and in September where traditionally there is a rise in installation rates.” As a result, third quarter revenue, gross margin and operating income will be below the low end of the prior guidance range.

While Enphase has lower exposure to Europe and done a better job derisking Q3 estimates, the company's near-term outlook is likely to fall well short of current consensus estimates. adamkaz/E+ via Getty Images After the close of Wednesday's regular session, leading solar string inverter manufacturer SolarEdge Technologies Inc. (SEDG) or \"SolarEdge\" surprised market participants with an ugly earnings warning (emphasis added by author): During the second part of the third quarter of 2023, we experienced substantial unexpected cancellations and pushouts of existing backlog from our European distributors,” said Zvi Lando, Chief Executive Officer of SolarEdge. “We attribute these cancellations and pushouts to higher than expected inventory in the channels and slower than expected installation rates. In particular, installation rates for the third quarter were much slower at the end of the summer and in September where traditionally there is a rise in installation rates.” As a result, third quarter revenue, gross margin and operating income will be below the low end of the prior guidance range. Additionally, the Company anticipates significantly lower revenues in"

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates. The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 12, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This maker of industrial and construction fasteners is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +2%. Revenues are expected to be $1.85 billion, up 2.7% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts. Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Story continues Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Fastenal? For Fastenal, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.72%. On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4. So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Fastenal will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue? While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Fastenal would post earnings of $0.52 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.52, delivering no surprise. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times. Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Fastenal doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

The proprietary ranking system focuses on the underlying health of a company through analysis of its stock price, earnings, and growth rate. FAST has a better value than 23% of stocks based on these valuation analytics. Investors primarily focused on buy-and-hold strategies will find the valuation ranking relevant to their goals when making investment decisions. FAST gets a 23 Valuation Rank today. Find out what this means to you and get the rest of the rankings on FAST! See Full FAST Report Metrics Analysis FAST has a trailing twelve month Price to Earnings (PE) ratio of 27.9 which places it above the histroical average of roughly 15. FAST is currently trading at a poor value due to investors paying more than what the stock is worth in relation to its earnings. FAST's trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS) of 1.96 does not justify its share price in the market. Trailing PE ratios do not factor in the company's projected growth rate, thus, some firms will have high PE ratios caused by high growth recruiting more investors even if the underlying company has produced low earnings so far. FAST currently has a 12-month-forward-PE-to-Growth (PEG) ratio of 3.04. The market is currently overvaluing FAST in relation to its projected growth due to the PEG ratio being above the fair market value of 1. FAST's PEG comes from its forward price to earnings ratio being divided by its growth rate. Because PEG ratios include more fundamentals of a company's overall health with additional focus on the future, they are one of the most used valuation metrics by analysts. Summary All together these valuation metrics paint a pretty poor picture for FAST at its current price due to a overvalued PEG ratio due to strong growth. The PE and PEG for FAST are worse than the average of the market resulting in a valuation score of 23.

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Fastenal's shares before the 1st of February to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 2nd of March. The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.35 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$1.40 per share to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Fastenal has a trailing yield of 2.8% on the current share price of $49.61. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to investigate whether Fastenal can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. See our latest analysis for Fastenal Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Fastenal paid out more than half (65%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. The company paid out 93% of its free cash flow over the last year, which we think is outside the ideal range for most businesses. Companies usually need cash more than they need earnings - expenses don't pay themselves - so it's not great to see it paying out so much of its cash flow. While Fastenal's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, cash is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were Fastenal to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign. Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends. NasdaqGS:FAST Historic Dividend January 27th 2023 Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing? Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. For this reason, we're glad to see Fastenal's earnings per share have risen 14% per annum over the last five years. Earnings have been growing at a decent rate, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year. Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the past 10 years, Fastenal has increased its dividend at approximately 14% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see. The Bottom Line From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Fastenal? Earnings per share growth is a positive, and the company's payout ratio looks normal. However, we note Fastenal paid out a much higher percentage of its free cash flow, which makes us uncomfortable. It might be worth researching if the company is reinvesting in growth projects that could grow earnings and dividends in the future, but for now we're not all that optimistic on its dividend prospects. So if you want to do more digging on Fastenal, you'll find it worthwhile knowing the risks that this stock faces. For example, we've found 1 warning sign for Fastenal that we recommend you consider before investing in the business. A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

Here's what investors need to know before the announcement. Analysts estimate that Fastenal will report an earnings per share (EPS) of $0.42. Fastenal bulls will hope to hear the company announce they've not only beaten that estimate, but also to provide positive guidance, or forecasted growth, for the next quarter. New investors should note that it is sometimes not an earnings beat or miss that most affects the price of a stock, but the guidance (or forecast). Past Earnings Performance Last quarter the company beat EPS by $0.02, which was followed by a 6.24% drop in the share price the next day. Here's a look at Fastenal's past performance and the resulting price change: Quarter Q3 2022 Q2 2022 Q1 2022 Q4 2021 EPS Estimate 0.48 0.5 0.44 0.38 EPS Actual 0.50 0.5 0.47 0.40 Price Change % -6.24% 1.22% -5.04% -3.19% Stock Performance Shares of Fastenal were trading at $48.22 as of January 16. Over the last 52-week period, shares are down 13.98%. Given that these returns are generally negative, long-term shareholders are likely bearish going into this earnings release.

Not only did the results outperform the market’s expectations, but it announced another dividend increase. A dividend increase on its own is good, but this one looks a lot better when you consider the number of annual increases that came before it, which were 24. This means the latest increase, the 25th consecutive annual increase, qualifies the stock as a Dividend Aristocrat. Again, not so much of a catalyst until you think of all the indices and ETFs pegged to the Dividend Aristocrat Index. There are dozens of Dividend Aristocrat ETFs, the top two are worth more than $90 billion in market cap, which makes for a powerful tailwind for this stock because all those ETFs will need to buy some of Fastenal to maintain their allocation.

The insiders, except for 1 sale by an EVP, have only bought this stock for the last 5 quarters, and the institutional activity is the same. The institutions were barely net-sellers for a single quarter in 2022 but netted shares for 10 of the 11 quarters leading up to the present and including Q1 of 2023. This has the total institutional ownership up to 77% and growing if the Q4 results have anything to do with it. Fastenal Beats On The Top And Bottom Lines Fastenal had a mixed quarter on a segment basis, but 2 things stand out. The company produced market-beating revenue and earnings despite weakness in 2 of the 4 core segments. At the same time, portfolio diversification, specifically the expansion into international markets, helped to offset the aforementioned weakness. The revenue of $1.69 billion is not only up 10.5%, but it beat the consensus by 120 basis points, and the strength carried through to the bottom line. On a segment basis, the Capital Equipment and Commercial segments both produced growth while the Consumer and Construction segments both contracted; no surprise.

The company says mix, FX headwinds and the combination of input prices and pricing actions are to blame. The company eased off on pricing actions in the quarter due to a moderation in inflation that may lead to higher margins in 2023, assuming inflationary pressures continue to decline. Regarding the margin, the gross margin was contracted by 70 basis points but was offset by an improvement in SG&A that left the operating margin flat on a YOY basis. This left GAAP earnings at $0.43 or up $0.03 from last year, a penny ahead of consensus, and in a good position to maintain dividend health and continue repurchases. Fastenal On Tack For Capital Returns In 2023 Fastenal increased its quarterly dividend payment by nearly 12% when it released the Q4 results. This is a slowdown from the 14% CAGR the company has been running but still a healthy increase and one that is more sustainable. Currently, the stock is yielding more than 2.6%, which is a full 125 basis points above the broad market and here are share repurchases to consider as well. The company has up to 6.2 million shares left under its current authorization, which amounts to about 1% of the outstanding shares. The Technical Outlook: Fastenal Is Bottoming Shares of Fastenal hit bottom in early October 2022 and appear to be returning to retest support now. The post-release action has the stock down about 0.6% in premarket trading and above key support at the $45 level. There is a chance for support to kick in at the higher $47 level, but that needs to be confirmed by the market. A fall below $47 is not necessarily bearish, but a move below $45 might be. Longer term, this stock should find a firm bottom soon and begin moving sideways in preparation for the next economic expansion if it doesn’t do so today.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ from anticipated results are contained in the company's latest earnings release and periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and we encourage you to review those factors carefully. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Florness. Dan Florness: Thank you, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call, and Happy New Year. If you -- some highlights on the quarter. I'm on Page 3 of the flip -- of flipbook. So our daily sales grew 10.7% in the quarter, eased a bit from what we've seen in recent quarters, primarily because of tougher comparisons to what we were seeing in the fourth quarter last year, but also some moderating demand. I'm pleased to say that our fourth quarter operating margin remained stable at 19.6% and our ability to generate cash. So we're looking at our cash conversion, it returned to historic levels. And that's really a sign of moderation and the level of inflation that we're seeing in the marketplace. But also a more stable supply chain and the ability to not need -- that for a double negative, not need to expand our stocking levels to ensure a reliable supply line for our customers. Story continues So it gives us some flexibility as we go into 2023. Very pleased to see that. 2022 was a year of milestones and they all centered on $1 billion. So in October, our e-commerce revenues surpassed $1 billion for the first time ever. Our -- and that's on an annual looking at annual milestone. Our international sales exceeded $1 billion. We hit that milestone in the month of November. And as noted in the release this morning, our company-wide net earnings topped $1 billion for the first time ever and that was for calendar 2022. When I look at that chart on the upper left, it's hard to decide where do you start explaining all the the noise you have really over the last 3 years, as we went through COVID, as we emerged from Covius, as we went through supply chain disruptions and inflationary period. So I chose to not and just compare to 2019 from the standpoint of what was our cumulative sales growth in each of the quarters of this year because I think it tells a more stable story and talks about the things that we've built. So in the first quarter of 2022, we were 28.1% larger than we were in the first quarter of 2019. This expanded to 30% in the second quarter, expanded to about 31% in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter, we're about 35% larger than we were in the fourth quarter of 2019. Now you shouldn't conclude from that, that, Geez, that expanded 7 points from Q1 to Q4. Because in all -- in full disclosure, 2019 was weakening a bit as we went through the year. I would see this as ignoring COVID, ignoring supply chain, ignoring inflation, we're 30% bigger than we were 3 years ago, and I think that's a testament to the business model and to the team executing the model and the marketplace, recognizing Fastenal for what it is, a great supply chain partner to their business. If -- and I'm pleased to say, I think we're exiting the pandemic stronger than we entered. The -- we experienced margin pressure in the fourth quarter, and Holden will touch on that in more detail later in the call. Fasteners were challenging, but we understood what's going on there, and we knew what was coming. The safety, I would say the same thing, it's challenging like anything is challenging, but we knew what to expect there. And I think on these first 2 buckets of fasteners and safety, we understood it, and we managed through it quite well. The remaining clients, a lot of those products, aren't as prevalent in the recurring pattern, the planned spend component of our business, whether it be through the vending portion of FMI or the BIN or the FASTStock portion of FMI. And so it takes different tools and different means to manage that. And we had some challenges there. And again, Holden will touch on a little bit more later in the call. When I look at the final piece and the reason we were able to maintain a stable operating margin, we've done a really nice job with headcount. We did add a few more people in the fourth quarter than I would have liked to have seen. I suspect some of it is after a period of being really difficult hiring and as it eased throughout the year, there are some spots that we needed to fill, that were filled. But I look at it in totality for the year. We've really done a nice job. And I'll touch on it a few more -- a little bit more in a few minutes, but we've done a nice job in the last 3 years as well. Flipping to Page 4 of the foot book, the -- Onsite, we had 62 signings in the fourth quarter and finished with 1,623 active sites, so up about 15% from a year ago. The -- if you ignore the sales at transfer over when we opened an Onsite, where it's an existing customer, we grew our Onsite-based revenue in the high teens and reiterate our goal for 2023, our intention is to sign 375 to 400 Onsites next year. And I'm pleased to see, for us, we often talk about participation inside the organization. Just over 80% of our district managers signed an Onsite back in 2019, and when society closed up and folks weren't as excited about us moving in to stay with them during the day, our -- that participation dropped dramatically as our Onsite dropped in both 2020 and 2021. And I'm pleased to say in 2022, 80% of our district managers signed at least 1 Onsite. Now would I prefer to see that go to 85% or 90%? Sure, I would. But 80% is a nice threshold to get above again because we have done it once before, and that was in 2019. So my congratulations to the team. FMI Technology. We signed 4,730 weighted devices in the fourth quarter, that's 76 per day. A year ago, we were signing 64 per day. And the activity through our FMI Technology platform represented almost 39% of sales in the fourth quarter. That was 35% a year ago and 27% 2 years ago. For 2023, our goal is to sign between 23,000 and 25,000 MEU devices, whether it be FASTBin or FASTVend. E-commerce, the next piece of our, what we call, digital footprint, daily sales rose 48% in the fourth quarter. Again, incredible traction in that area. We've really seen that traction move in the last 3 years, partly a function of COVID, and I think a lot of people are seeing those kinds of patterns, but also -- we've gotten better as an organization and our ability to execute on e-commerce, and that's times through the numbers as well. So EDI and punched out catalogs and really large customer-oriented e-commerce was up 45% and our web sales was up almost 60%. Looking at our digital footprint. So that's looking at FMI plus the piece of e-commerce that doesn't come from FMI was 52.6% of sales in the fourth quarter, and that was 46.5% a year ago. Our goal is 65% of net sales going through our digital footprint next year. In the interest of full disclosure, that's an aggressive goal, but it's our goal nonetheless. If I flip into Page 5, we put this table in the release last January as well. And it's really intended to show over time what's really happening to our network. And that is, as FMI becomes a bigger piece of our business, as our mix of customers changes, as e-commerce becomes a bigger piece, you rationalize your footprint because you need for a footprint change. So you can see in 2013, we peaked out, and I'm going to start at the bottom of this set of bullets and work my way up. So in 2013, looking at our data, we had a 30-minute access to about 95% of the U.S. manufacturing base. And this is just looking at the U.S. branch network because the Canada follows a similar trend as far as what you've seen in the number of branches, whereas the rest of the planet are continuing to open locations because we're quite young there. Looking at the 1,450, which we think is the ultimate number we get to for branch count, the -- in the U.S. and Canada, the U.S. piece of that where we have really good data, we think that 95% drops to about 93.5%, which we think is incredible coverage and puts us in a great position to be a great local supply chain partner and still have a really efficient network. And you're seeing that in our operating expenses over the last few years. If you look at our headcount numbers -- and I touched on it earlier, and I thought I'd share a different view rather than the year-over-year view you have on Page 5 of the earnings release. And that is, again, a 3-year view of what's happening. So our in-market locations from an absolute basis since 2019, our headcount is down about 567 people in the branch and Onsite network, which is about a 4% drop. And again, things like FMI and rationalizing locations have really allowed us to leverage that. However, our sales headcount is up because every headcount we've reduced has moved into some type of sales role supporting the branch and Onsite network. So I'm pleased to say we were able to realign our resources in that time frame and really be a better growth-driving organization for the long term that aligns with our strategy of a branch and Onsite network. The other thing that should stand out is a year ago, we had 377 more branches relative to Onsite. So we had 1,416 Onsites. We had 1,793. So 377 delta between the 2. At the end of 2022, that delta has contracted to 60. So we have 1,623 OnSites. We have 1,683 branches. I don't know what quarter that flips. But it won't be too much -- too far into our future that we'll actually have more Onsites than branches which has been very much a planned thing within our business over time. Again, the FMI digital footprint helped us leverage our headcount and our rationalization of branches. The other piece that's an important and growing component, we've talked about our LIFT initiative, and we ended the year with just over 17,000 of our vending machines being resupplied out of our LIFT facility, which really allows us to operate more efficiently, ultimately allows us to rationalize some working capital, and our sales team can focus on selling more than managing some of the back-office items in a branch. The final thing, if you look at our headcount over the 3-year period is we've been able to really rationalize our support labor. So we have added folks in the distribution because of LIFT. However, in the -- if I look at DC and manufacturing, we're up 98 people in the last 3 years. So again, that team has done an incredible job of managing their headcount. And if I look at our support areas in general, 51% of our headcount increase in the last 3 years has been focus going into IT. That's how we're able to do things like FMI, how we're able to do things like LIFT and build the technology to support it. 35% has gone into either a growth driver or into our international team or supporting our sales team and 14% has gone into all other categories combined in the last 3 years. I think that's an organization that dramatically improved itself in the last 3 years as we prepared for the future. One last item -- when you see our release in February, I usually don't get ahead of myself on what's going to be in a future release. One thing to note is in 2022, our team in India added approximately 50 interns, and we ended up hiring 54 of them because a number of those interns told their friends about Fastenal, and they joined the Blue team and they added to our IT group. We saw such great success with that. It's a very efficient way to add folks. Here in early January, we added 96 -- or 98, 1 of the 2. So you're going to see the number grow by about 100 in the month of January in our support infrastructure. Don't conclude from that Fastenal is not managing its headcount. Conclude from that Fastenal is investing in resources to support its technology side. With that, I'll turn it over to Holden. Photo by Tekton on Unsplash Holden Lewis: Great. Thanks, Dan. Starting on Slide 6. Total and daily sales increased 10.7% in the fourth quarter of 2022, which included an up 8% reading in December and represented further deceleration from prior quarters. We attribute this deceleration to slower industrial production, which shouldn't surprise anyone that tracks the purchasing manager index and more difficult growth and pricing comparisons. But even so, significant elements of our business continue to perform well. For instance, manufacturing, which was roughly 73% of our sales in the fourth quarter of 2022, grew 16% and slightly exceeded normal quarterly sequentials. In addition, our largest customers, as reflected by our national accounts program and which approximated 59% of our sales in the fourth quarter of 2022, grew 15%. We believe continued healthy performance in these areas reflect our investments in Onsite and changes to our branch structure and sales roles. Feedback from our regional leadership on the outlook entering 2023 remain constructive and largely unchanged from the third quarter of 2022. There are a few areas where we have seen incremental weakness, however. For instance, a handful of our large retailer customers tightened their belts regarding facilities and labor and our non-North American sales softened on a strong dollar and geopolitical events. Now we've made significant investments and seeing enormous growth in these areas over the last few years and the current weakness in our view relates to market-specific factors. Construction revenues were also softer, which reflects the conscious decision we have made to position our branches to focus on larger key accounts, which is contributing to better labor leverage. These 3 areas, large retailers, non-North American markets and construction together, represent more than 15% of sales and went from double-digit growth as recently as the first quarter of 2022 to declining in each case by the fourth quarter of 2022. As always, we have limited visibility as it relates to future demand. However, we do believe that our sales initiatives continue to gain momentum and expect good outgrowth in 2023. Now to Slide 7. Operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2022 was 19.6%, flat from the prior year. We continue to manage operating expenses effectively, producing 120 basis points of SG&A leverage in the fourth quarter of 2022. Occupancy costs are being restrained from strategic branch closures, while initiatives such as digital footprint, LIFT and the changes we've made to our brand strategies are contributing to improved labor leverage, which accelerated in 2022. As Dan indicated in his opening remarks, we were a bit more aggressive with headcount adds that might be prudent given the cloudy manufacturing outlook heading into 2023. However, we think that can adjust quickly, and it is likely annual FTE growth peaked in December or will peak in January before decelerating through the first half of 2023. Although the ultimate level of growth in the marketplace will have it say, we do believe that we can continue to leverage operating expenses in future periods. SG&A leverage was offset by a matching 120 basis points decline in gross margin, which was greater than anticipated. Certain factors were familiar. The drag related to product and customer mix widened as non-fastener growth began outpacing fastener growth, which was expected. The price cost drag widened slightly, which is a little more than expected, reflecting some improvement on the fastener side but incremental challenges in other products offsetting this. In fact, we experienced broader product margin pressure in our non-fastener and non-safety products. These categories tend to have a less centralized supply chain and the spend tends to be more unplanned, which when combined with slower demand and a better stock marketplace resulted in broader discounting. We believe this relates more to our actions than the state of the market and have plans to address it in the first quarter of 2023. On the positive side of the margin ledger, we continue to have healthy freight revenues and narrower losses related to maintaining our captive fleets. We had a higher tax rate, reflecting the absence of certain favorable reserve adjustments that benefited the fourth quarter of 2021 than higher nondeductible payroll and state income tax expenses in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our fully diluted share count was also down 0.8% from share buybacks for the last 2 quarters. Putting it all together, we reported fourth quarter 2022 EPS of $0.43, up 7.1% from $0.40 in the fourth quarter of 2021. Now turning to Slide 8. We generated $302 million in operating cash in the fourth quarter of 2022 or approximately 123% of net income in the period. This reflects a typical fourth quarter conversion rate in contrast with the preceding 5 quarters where our conversion rates lagged. This is due to comparisons in the second half of 2021, we began to finance significantly more working capital to navigate supply chain constraints and inflation. We do not expect to have to make a similar incremental investment in 2023, which should produce better cash flow. Year-over-year, accounts receivable was up 12.6% on higher customer demand and an increase in the mix of larger key account customers, which tend to have longer terms. Inventories rose 12.1%. The supply chain has largely normalized. Inflation is moderating. And our fulfillment rates are at healthy levels, which is causing our inventory growth to align more closely with growth than was true earlier in the year. Our days on hand was 161.5, more than 4 days better than the fourth quarter of 2021 and more than 13 days below the fourth quarter of 2019 despite the challenges in the last 18 months. We continue to identify sustainable efficiencies in how we manage our inventories. Net capital spending in 2022 was $162.4 million, a bit below the $170 million to $190 million anticipated at the end of the third quarter, mostly related to project and equipment deferrals. Those deferrals, combined with higher spending on hub investments, fleet equipment and IT equipment, resulted in an anticipated net capital spending range for 2023 of $210 million to $230 million. We finished the fourth quarter of 2022 with debt at 14.9% of total capital, up from 11.4% in the fourth quarter of 2021 and unchanged at 14.9% in the third quarter of 2022. Though we had strong cash generation in the fourth quarter of 2022, we were also, again, more aggressive in returning cash to shareholders in the form of $177 million in dividends and $93 million in share buyback. Last night, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.31 in the first quarter of 2021 to -- I'm sorry, of 2022 to $0.35 in the first quarter of 2023. Now before the questions, one quick note. This week, we released our inaugural ESG report, which is accessible through the ESG link found at the bottom of fastenal.com. This report highlights the strong alignment of FAST culture and mission with the environmental and human capital objectives of our stakeholders. I want to congratulate and thank the community of Blue Team members that work to pull this outstanding piece together. And with that, operator, we'll turn it over to Q&A. Dan Florness: Before we start Q&A, my adder to the Holden's comment on the ESG report, I encourage to focus on this call to read it. Don't wait for the movie. It's a -- I think it's a well-written story in the context of how Fastenal tell its story about how our business and our team have addressed this topic really throughout our history, but communicated in a way that is conscious of the formatting in the structure that society has grown more accustomed to. The other piece that I wanted to highlight is another announcement went out last night, which was, we announced that our international team has surpassed $1 billion in revenue for the first time during 2022. My congratulations to everybody listening to this call as part of our international team that spans the Americas, Europe and Asia. And to our team in China, where -- your society has opened a bunch more in recent months, recent weeks, I would like to wish you a Happy Chinese New Year. I believe it's the year of the rabbit. And I hope you since I -- sincerely hope you have a nice opportunity to visit with family as the socities opened up a little bit more. With that, we open the Q&A.

Analysts estimate that Fastenal will report an earnings per share (EPS) of $0.42. Fastenal bulls will hope to hear the company announce they've not only beaten that estimate, but also to provide positive guidance, or forecasted growth, for the next quarter. New investors should note that it is sometimes not an earnings beat or miss that most affects the price of a stock, but the guidance (or forecast). Past Earnings Performance Last quarter the company beat EPS by $0.02, which was followed by a 6.24% drop in the share price the next day.

        "content": "Fastenal NASDAQ: FAST just reported its Q4 earnings and has given the market more than 1 reason to become a buyer of this stock. Not only did the results outperform the market’s expectations, but it announced another dividend increase. A dividend increase on its own is good, but this one looks a lot better when you consider the number of annual increases that came before it, which were 24. This means the latest increase, the 25th consecutive annual increase, qualifies the stock as a Dividend Aristocrat. Again, not so much of a catalyst until you think of all the indices and ETFs pegged to the Dividend Aristocrat Index. There are dozens of Dividend Aristocrat ETFs, the top two are worth more than $90 billion in market cap, which makes for a powerful tailwind for this stock because all those ETFs will need to buy some of Fastenal to maintain their allocation. Get Fastenal alerts: The insiders and institutions have been buying this stock over the last year in preparation for this day. The insiders, except for 1 sale by an EVP, have only bought this stock for the last 5 quarters, and the institutional activity is the same. The institutions were barely net-sellers for a single quarter in 2022 but netted shares for 10 of the 11 quarters leading up to the present and including Q1 of 2023. This has the total institutional ownership up to 77% and growing if the Q4 results have anything to do with it. Fastenal Beats On The Top And Bottom Lines Fastenal had a mixed quarter on a segment basis, but 2 things stand out. The company produced market-beating revenue and earnings despite weakness in 2 of the 4 core segments. At the same time, portfolio diversification, specifically the expansion into international markets, helped to offset the aforementioned weakness. The revenue of $1.69 billion is not only up 10.5%, but it beat the consensus by 120 basis points, and the strength carried through to the bottom line. On a segment basis, the Capital Equipment and Commercial segments both produced growth while the Consumer and Construction segments both contracted; no surprise.

The company says mix, FX headwinds and the combination of input prices and pricing actions are to blame. The company eased off on pricing actions in the quarter due to a moderation in inflation that may lead to higher margins in 2023, assuming inflationary pressures continue to decline. Regarding the margin, the gross margin was contracted by 70 basis points but was offset by an improvement in SG&A that left the operating margin flat on a YOY basis. This left GAAP earnings at $0.43 or up $0.03 from last year, a penny ahead of consensus, and in a good position to maintain dividend health and continue repurchases. Fastenal On Tack For Capital Returns In 2023 Fastenal increased its quarterly dividend payment by nearly 12% when it released the Q4 results. This is a slowdown from the 14% CAGR the company has been running but still a healthy increase and one that is more sustainable. Currently, the stock is yielding more than 2.6%, which is a full 125 basis points above the broad market and here are share repurchases to consider as well. The company has up to 6.2 million shares left under its current authorization, which amounts to about 1% of the outstanding shares. The Technical Outlook: Fastenal Is Bottoming Shares of Fastenal hit bottom in early October 2022 and appear to be returning to retest support now. The post-release action has the stock down about 0.6% in premarket trading and above key support at the $45 level. There is a chance for support to kick in at the higher $47 level, but that needs to be confirmed by the market. A fall below $47 is not necessarily bearish, but a move below $45 might be. Longer term, this stock should find a firm bottom soon and begin moving sideways in preparation for the next economic expansion if it doesn’t do so today.

        "content": "Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript January 19, 2023 Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Fastenal 2022 Annual and Fourth Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Taylor Ranta of Fastenal Company. Thank you. You may begin. Taylor Ranta: Welcome to the Fastenal Company 2022 annual and fourth quarter earnings conference call. This call will be hosted by Dan Florness, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Holden Lewis, our Chief Financial Officer. The call will last for up to one hour, and we'll start with a general overview of our annual and quarterly results and operations, with the remainder of the time being open for questions and answers.

These statements are based on our current expectations and we undertake no duty to update them. It is important note that the company's actual results may differ materially from those anticipated. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from anticipated results are contained in the company's latest earnings release and periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and we encourage you to review those factors carefully. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Florness. Dan Florness: Thank you, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call, and Happy New Year. If you -- some highlights on the quarter. I'm on Page 3 of the flip -- of flipbook. So our daily sales grew 10.7% in the quarter, eased a bit from what we've seen in recent quarters, primarily because of tougher comparisons to what we were seeing in the fourth quarter last year, but also some moderating demand. I'm pleased to say that our fourth quarter operating margin remained stable at 19.6% and our ability to generate cash. So we're looking at our cash conversion, it returned to historic levels. And that's really a sign of moderation and the level of inflation that we're seeing in the marketplace. But also a more stable supply chain and the ability to not need -- that for a double negative, not need to expand our stocking levels to ensure a reliable supply line for our customers. Story continues So it gives us some flexibility as we go into 2023. Very pleased to see that. 2022 was a year of milestones and they all centered on $1 billion. So in October, our e-commerce revenues surpassed $1 billion for the first time ever. Our -- and that's on an annual looking at annual milestone. Our international sales exceeded $1 billion. We hit that milestone in the month of November. And as noted in the release this morning, our company-wide net earnings topped $1 billion for the first time ever and that was for calendar 2022. When I look at that chart on the upper left, it's hard to decide where do you start explaining all the the noise you have really over the last 3 years, as we went through COVID, as we emerged from Covius, as we went through supply chain disruptions and inflationary period. So I chose to not and just compare to 2019 from the standpoint of what was our cumulative sales growth in each of the quarters of this year because I think it tells a more stable story and talks about the things that we've built. So in the first quarter of 2022, we were 28.1% larger than we were in the first quarter of 2019. This expanded to 30% in the second quarter, expanded to about 31% in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter, we're about 35% larger than we were in the fourth quarter of 2019. Now you shouldn't conclude from that, that, Geez, that expanded 7 points from Q1 to Q4. Because in all -- in full disclosure, 2019 was weakening a bit as we went through the year. I would see this as ignoring COVID, ignoring supply chain, ignoring inflation, we're 30% bigger than we were 3 years ago, and I think that's a testament to the business model and to the team executing the model and the marketplace, recognizing Fastenal for what it is, a great supply chain partner to their business. If -- and I'm pleased to say, I think we're exiting the pandemic stronger than we entered. The -- we experienced margin pressure in the fourth quarter, and Holden will touch on that in more detail later in the call. Fasteners were challenging, but we understood what's going on there, and we knew what was coming. The safety, I would say the same thing, it's challenging like anything is challenging, but we knew what to expect there. And I think on these first 2 buckets of fasteners and safety, we understood it, and we managed through it quite well. The remaining clients, a lot of those products, aren't as prevalent in the recurring pattern, the planned spend component of our business, whether it be through the vending portion of FMI or the BIN or the FASTStock portion of FMI. And so it takes different tools and different means to manage that. And we had some challenges there. And again, Holden will touch on a little bit more later in the call. When I look at the final piece and the reason we were able to maintain a stable operating margin, we've done a really nice job with headcount. We did add a few more people in the fourth quarter than I would have liked to have seen. I suspect some of it is after a period of being really difficult hiring and as it eased throughout the year, there are some spots that we needed to fill, that were filled. But I look at it in totality for the year. We've really done a nice job. And I'll touch on it a few more -- a little bit more in a few minutes, but we've done a nice job in the last 3 years as well. Flipping to Page 4 of the foot book, the -- Onsite, we had 62 signings in the fourth quarter and finished with 1,623 active sites, so up about 15% from a year ago. The -- if you ignore the sales at transfer over when we opened an Onsite, where it's an existing customer, we grew our Onsite-based revenue in the high teens and reiterate our goal for 2023, our intention is to sign 375 to 400 Onsites next year. And I'm pleased to see, for us, we often talk about participation inside the organization. Just over 80% of our district managers signed an Onsite back in 2019, and when society closed up and folks weren't as excited about us moving in to stay with them during the day, our -- that participation dropped dramatically as our Onsite dropped in both 2020 and 2021. And I'm pleased to say in 2022, 80% of our district managers signed at least 1 Onsite. Now would I prefer to see that go to 85% or 90%? Sure, I would. But 80% is a nice threshold to get above again because we have done it once before, and that was in 2019. So my congratulations to the team. FMI Technology. We signed 4,730 weighted devices in the fourth quarter, that's 76 per day. A year ago, we were signing 64 per day. And the activity through our FMI Technology platform represented almost 39% of sales in the fourth quarter. That was 35% a year ago and 27% 2 years ago. For 2023, our goal is to sign between 23,000 and 25,000 MEU devices, whether it be FASTBin or FASTVend. E-commerce, the next piece of our, what we call, digital footprint, daily sales rose 48% in the fourth quarter. Again, incredible traction in that area. We've really seen that traction move in the last 3 years, partly a function of COVID, and I think a lot of people are seeing those kinds of patterns, but also -- we've gotten better as an organization and our ability to execute on e-commerce, and that's times through the numbers as well. So EDI and punched out catalogs and really large customer-oriented e-commerce was up 45% and our web sales was up almost 60%. Looking at our digital footprint. So that's looking at FMI plus the piece of e-commerce that doesn't come from FMI was 52.6% of sales in the fourth quarter, and that was 46.5% a year ago. Our goal is 65% of net sales going through our digital footprint next year. In the interest of full disclosure, that's an aggressive goal, but it's our goal nonetheless. If I flip into Page 5, we put this table in the release last January as well. And it's really intended to show over time what's really happening to our network. And that is, as FMI becomes a bigger piece of our business, as our mix of customers changes, as e-commerce becomes a bigger piece, you rationalize your footprint because you need for a footprint change. So you can see in 2013, we peaked out, and I'm going to start at the bottom of this set of bullets and work my way up. So in 2013, looking at our data, we had a 30-minute access to about 95% of the U.S. manufacturing base. And this is just looking at the U.S. branch network because the Canada follows a similar trend as far as what you've seen in the number of branches, whereas the rest of the planet are continuing to open locations because we're quite young there. Looking at the 1,450, which we think is the ultimate number we get to for branch count, the -- in the U.S. and Canada, the U.S. piece of that where we have really good data, we think that 95% drops to about 93.5%, which we think is incredible coverage and puts us in a great position to be a great local supply chain partner and still have a really efficient network. And you're seeing that in our operating expenses over the last few years. If you look at our headcount numbers -- and I touched on it earlier, and I thought I'd share a different view rather than the year-over-year view you have on Page 5 of the earnings release. And that is, again, a 3-year view of what's happening. So our in-market locations from an absolute basis since 2019, our headcount is down about 567 people in the branch and Onsite network, which is about a 4% drop. And again, things like FMI and rationalizing locations have really allowed us to leverage that. However, our sales headcount is up because every headcount we've reduced has moved into some type of sales role supporting the branch and Onsite network. So I'm pleased to say we were able to realign our resources in that time frame and really be a better growth-driving organization for the long term that aligns with our strategy of a branch and Onsite network. The other thing that should stand out is a year ago, we had 377 more branches relative to Onsite. So we had 1,416 Onsites. We had 1,793. So 377 delta between the 2. At the end of 2022, that delta has contracted to 60. So we have 1,623 OnSites. We have 1,683 branches. I don't know what quarter that flips. But it won't be too much -- too far into our future that we'll actually have more Onsites than branches which has been very much a planned thing within our business over time. Again, the FMI digital footprint helped us leverage our headcount and our rationalization of branches. The other piece that's an important and growing component, we've talked about our LIFT initiative, and we ended the year with just over 17,000 of our vending machines being resupplied out of our LIFT facility, which really allows us to operate more efficiently, ultimately allows us to rationalize some working capital, and our sales team can focus on selling more than managing some of the back-office items in a branch. The final thing, if you look at our headcount over the 3-year period is we've been able to really rationalize our support labor. So we have added folks in the distribution because of LIFT. However, in the -- if I look at DC and manufacturing, we're up 98 people in the last 3 years. So again, that team has done an incredible job of managing their headcount. And if I look at our support areas in general, 51% of our headcount increase in the last 3 years has been focus going into IT. That's how we're able to do things like FMI, how we're able to do things like LIFT and build the technology to support it. 35% has gone into either a growth driver or into our international team or supporting our sales team and 14% has gone into all other categories combined in the last 3 years. I think that's an organization that dramatically improved itself in the last 3 years as we prepared for the future. One last item -- when you see our release in February, I usually don't get ahead of myself on what's going to be in a future release. One thing to note is in 2022, our team in India added approximately 50 interns, and we ended up hiring 54 of them because a number of those interns told their friends about Fastenal, and they joined the Blue team and they added to our IT group. We saw such great success with that. It's a very efficient way to add folks. Here in early January, we added 96 -- or 98, 1 of the 2. So you're going to see the number grow by about 100 in the month of January in our support infrastructure. Don't conclude from that Fastenal is not managing its headcount. Conclude from that Fastenal is investing in resources to support its technology side. With that, I'll turn it over to Holden. Photo by Tekton on Unsplash Holden Lewis: Great. Thanks, Dan. Starting on Slide 6. Total and daily sales increased 10.7% in the fourth quarter of 2022, which included an up 8% reading in December and represented further deceleration from prior quarters. We attribute this deceleration to slower industrial production, which shouldn't surprise anyone that tracks the purchasing manager index and more difficult growth and pricing comparisons. But even so, significant elements of our business continue to perform well. For instance, manufacturing, which was roughly 73% of our sales in the fourth quarter of 2022, grew 16% and slightly exceeded normal quarterly sequentials. In addition, our largest customers, as reflected by our national accounts program and which approximated 59% of our sales in the fourth quarter of 2022, grew 15%. We believe continued healthy performance in these areas reflect our investments in Onsite and changes to our branch structure and sales roles. Feedback from our regional leadership on the outlook entering 2023 remain constructive and largely unchanged from the third quarter of 2022. There are a few areas where we have seen incremental weakness, however. For instance, a handful of our large retailer customers tightened their belts regarding facilities and labor and our non-North American sales softened on a strong dollar and geopolitical events. Now we've made significant investments and seeing enormous growth in these areas over the last few years and the current weakness in our view relates to market-specific factors. Construction revenues were also softer, which reflects the conscious decision we have made to position our branches to focus on larger key accounts, which is contributing to better labor leverage. These 3 areas, large retailers, non-North American markets and construction together, represent more than 15% of sales and went from double-digit growth as recently as the first quarter of 2022 to declining in each case by the fourth quarter of 2022. As always, we have limited visibility as it relates to future demand. However, we do believe that our sales initiatives continue to gain momentum and expect good outgrowth in 2023. Now to Slide 7. Operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2022 was 19.6%, flat from the prior year. We continue to manage operating expenses effectively, producing 120 basis points of SG&A leverage in the fourth quarter of 2022. Occupancy costs are being restrained from strategic branch closures, while initiatives such as digital footprint, LIFT and the changes we've made to our brand strategies are contributing to improved labor leverage, which accelerated in 2022. As Dan indicated in his opening remarks, we were a bit more aggressive with headcount adds that might be prudent given the cloudy manufacturing outlook heading into 2023. However, we think that can adjust quickly, and it is likely annual FTE growth peaked in December or will peak in January before decelerating through the first half of 2023. Although the ultimate level of growth in the marketplace will have it say, we do believe that we can continue to leverage operating expenses in future periods. SG&A leverage was offset by a matching 120 basis points decline in gross margin, which was greater than anticipated. Certain factors were familiar. The drag related to product and customer mix widened as non-fastener growth began outpacing fastener growth, which was expected. The price cost drag widened slightly, which is a little more than expected, reflecting some improvement on the fastener side but incremental challenges in other products offsetting this. In fact, we experienced broader product margin pressure in our non-fastener and non-safety products. These categories tend to have a less centralized supply chain and the spend tends to be more unplanned, which when combined with slower demand and a better stock marketplace resulted in broader discounting. We believe this relates more to our actions than the state of the market and have plans to address it in the first quarter of 2023. On the positive side of the margin ledger, we continue to have healthy freight revenues and narrower losses related to maintaining our captive fleets. We had a higher tax rate, reflecting the absence of certain favorable reserve adjustments that benefited the fourth quarter of 2021 than higher nondeductible payroll and state income tax expenses in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our fully diluted share count was also down 0.8% from share buybacks for the last 2 quarters. Putting it all together, we reported fourth quarter 2022 EPS of $0.43, up 7.1% from $0.40 in the fourth quarter of 2021. Now turning to Slide 8. We generated $302 million in operating cash in the fourth quarter of 2022 or approximately 123% of net income in the period. This reflects a typical fourth quarter conversion rate in contrast with the preceding 5 quarters where our conversion rates lagged. This is due to comparisons in the second half of 2021, we began to finance significantly more working capital to navigate supply chain constraints and inflation. We do not expect to have to make a similar incremental investment in 2023, which should produce better cash flow. Year-over-year, accounts receivable was up 12.6% on higher customer demand and an increase in the mix of larger key account customers, which tend to have longer terms. Inventories rose 12.1%. The supply chain has largely normalized. Inflation is moderating. And our fulfillment rates are at healthy levels, which is causing our inventory growth to align more closely with growth than was true earlier in the year. Our days on hand was 161.5, more than 4 days better than the fourth quarter of 2021 and more than 13 days below the fourth quarter of 2019 despite the challenges in the last 18 months. We continue to identify sustainable efficiencies in how we manage our inventories. Net capital spending in 2022 was $162.4 million, a bit below the $170 million to $190 million anticipated at the end of the third quarter, mostly related to project and equipment deferrals. Those deferrals, combined with higher spending on hub investments, fleet equipment and IT equipment, resulted in an anticipated net capital spending range for 2023 of $210 million to $230 million. We finished the fourth quarter of 2022 with debt at 14.9% of total capital, up from 11.4% in the fourth quarter of 2021 and unchanged at 14.9% in the third quarter of 2022. Though we had strong cash generation in the fourth quarter of 2022, we were also, again, more aggressive in returning cash to shareholders in the form of $177 million in dividends and $93 million in share buyback. Last night, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.31 in the first quarter of 2021 to -- I'm sorry, of 2022 to $0.35 in the first quarter of 2023. Now before the questions, one quick note. This week, we released our inaugural ESG report, which is accessible through the ESG link found at the bottom of fastenal.com. This report highlights the strong alignment of FAST culture and mission with the environmental and human capital objectives of our stakeholders. I want to congratulate and thank the community of Blue Team members that work to pull this outstanding piece together. And with that, operator, we'll turn it over to Q&A. Dan Florness: Before we start Q&A, my adder to the Holden's comment on the ESG report, I encourage to focus on this call to read it. Don't wait for the movie. It's a -- I think it's a well-written story in the context of how Fastenal tell its story about how our business and our team have addressed this topic really throughout our history, but communicated in a way that is conscious of the formatting in the structure that society has grown more accustomed to. The other piece that I wanted to highlight is another announcement went out last night, which was, we announced that our international team has surpassed $1 billion in revenue for the first time during 2022. My congratulations to everybody listening to this call as part of our international team that spans the Americas, Europe and Asia. And to our team in China, where -- your society has opened a bunch more in recent months, recent weeks, I would like to wish you a Happy Chinese New Year. I believe it's the year of the rabbit. And I hope you since I -- sincerely hope you have a nice opportunity to visit with family as the socities opened up a little bit more. With that, we open the Q&A.

This gives Arizonans three digital platforms to choose from. Arizona first offered the mobile driver license in 2021, then in 2022 added Apple Wallet. “Arizona is proud to again be one of the first states to give our residents the choice to add their ID to Google Wallet,” Arizona MVD Director Eric Jorgensen said. “We continue to seek out opportunities for products and services that provide Arizonans convenience, security and privacy.” ADOT MVD embraces the motto, “Out of the line and safely on the road.” This is a nod to MVD’s commitment to reducing in-office wait times and offering customers a growing number of digital options, including the new technology of digital driver license and identification cards. Arizona is among the first few states in the nation whose residents can add their MVD-issued driver license or state ID card to Google Wallet and securely present it as a valid ID at select TSA airport security checkpoints. Arizona residents should continue to carry their physical driver license or state ID card to use in other situations, including with law enforcement.

The shift in patterns comes as many expect the ground invasion of Gaza to begin any day. “In response to the evolving situation in the region, we have temporarily disabled the ability to see live traffic conditions and busyness information out of consideration for the safety of local communities,” a Google spokesperson told Fortune. While live traffic conditions will not be shown, Google says that the apps will still assist drivers with step-by-step directions that take current traffic conditions into account. ETAs on the apps will also incorporate traffic data. This isn’t the first time Google has limited visibility about traffic conditions. Last year, after Russia invaded Ukraine, the company temporarily disabled the real-time data. (It’s unclear if it has returned.) Google did not clarify if the apps would also disable traffic data in Gaza. The war in the Middle East has already claimed thousands of lives and threatens to become a much bloodier affair—with the threat of becoming a broader regional conflict. The thinking behind the shielding of traffic information is it limits Hamas’s ability to target areas with a dense number of potential targets. Over 1,300 Israelis lost their lives on Oct. 7, mostly civilians. Hundreds more were killed from an attack on a Gaza hospital that was the result of failed Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket, according to Israeli and U.S. officials.

Recent layoffs unlikely to change business trajectory. JHVEPhoto Investment Conclusion Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) disappointing F4Q2022 financial results are consistent with the challenging long-term outlook, we outlined in our initiation report on the company published in November. Longer term, GOOG remains a waning corporation, deriving a majority of its revenues and earnings from technologies, it launched decades ago, with no definitive strategy to insulate these segments from the growing competition. Moreover, the firm appears to lack a pipeline that would assume the lead as the current business fades. Citing Artificial Intelligence (AI), as a growth driver appears disingenuous, as given that AI is the focus of most of the technology industry, it would be strange if AI was not being incorporated into Alphabet’s business. In addition, Google Cloud, as a long-term growth driver is hardly a plan, as the business is a distant third in the industry, with market share in single digits.

A project with the size and complexity of MDN – a collaborative undertaking to document web platform technologies – requires great effort to keep content up-to-date, accurate and accessible for the broadest audience. Coordinating the activities of staff, partners and a community of volunteers and contributors who work on different areas of the website requires considerable focus and proactive planning. In the last month alone, 175 people contributed over 450 pull requests to the English language content repository. Dozens of additional repositories complement or are incorporated into the site, including browser compatibility data, code examples, demo applications and significant community-driven efforts to localize the site into seven languages. It’s crucial that contributors can quickly and easily see what others are doing or planning so that we can avoid conflicting work. We also want to ensure that work by community contributors fits with the content on the site, so that their efforts lead to changes that ultimately will be accepted and published. Coming together To help with community coordination and to keep the MDN contribution process running efficiently, Mozilla and Open Web Docs have created a shared and open roadmap for ongoing and planned work. The roadmap will help everyone working on the project understand what’s coming up next across the site and the scope, requirements and impact of changes. For the project roadmap kickoff, Mozilla, Open Web Docs and representatives from Google, W3C and Microsoft met in London in January to discuss how to improve planning and collaboration and cement a shared vision for MDN’s future. We discussed the project’s current state, its challenges and how to improve the website for the benefit of readers. We also focused on ways to strengthen the project’s future and support a growing community that works on maintaining MDN as a trusted source of information for developers in the coming years. Goals of the shared roadmap Aside from the daily maintenance and chores relating to routine updates, the roadmap covers more complex tasks that require careful coordination and planning. The roadmap will help capture significant site changes, from content updates to navigation improvements. The goal is to make it easier to highlight the project’s priorities and to help contributors see planning, assignees and what tasks are available to pick up. During the London work week, the group identified the following key areas for the 2023 roadmap: Content lifecycle: We identified the maintenance cost of content additions during planning, defined sunsetting strategies and discussed ways to separate technical or implementation details from prose that may become quickly outdated. Information architecture: This covers the ongoing work to categorize and organize content on the site based on the type of technology it relates to and how it works with other technologies. Code examples: This covers the plans to make the different types of code examples displayed on MDN easier to maintain and contribute to and ways to simplify the editor that renders them on the page for readers. Discoverability: We discussed how to make it simple for developers to find the information they need while browsing the site, improving the site’s search functionality and making it more straightforward and exciting to discover new and related content. Platform and compatibility: This involves developing a hierarchy that groups platform features across technologies so that developers get a clear picture of whether they can use the features, what they relate to, and the browser and device support for these features. If you would like to read the details, the meeting minutes from all sessions are available in the Open Web Docs project repository on GitHub. Working closely with our partners MDN serves millions of developers daily who look for help implementing a web feature, learning about new technologies and finding compatibility information for their applications. Meeting with our partners in London has given us great confidence in the commitment to the success of MDN and a renewed focus on the project’s development. “With the web platform evolving so fast, keeping track and knowing what to use can be hard. In this context, MDN is an essential resource. We’re very happy to be working with partners that care so much about writing great documentation. Thank you to Mozilla for making it possible for us all to meet and align on our collective next steps. The future of web docs looks bright!” Patrick Brosset, Microsoft “Good documentation is critical to the adoption of any technology by developers, and MDN is an invaluable place for developers to learn about Web technologies standardized in W3C. I was thrilled to bring W3C’s perspectives on the shared roadmap that MDN and Open Web Docs are converging on – this paves the way for Web developers to get even faster documentation about all the new features regularly landing on the Web Platform.” Dominique Hazael-Massieux, W3C “We are very grateful for this opportunity. It was the first time we met as a group in person given Open Web Docs was founded during the global covid pandemic. Some of us met for the first time in real life.” Florian Scholz, Open Web Docs “MDN’s reference documentation is an integral part of developers’ lives, and I’m very happy for the ongoing collaboration with MDN to make sure web platform features and APIs are fully documented to enable developers to be successful on the web.” Robert Nyman, Google Having Open Web Docs, W3C, Google and Microsoft join us in person was an excellent opportunity to discuss ongoing efforts to support web platform documentation for the benefit of web developers and designers worldwide. This community of developers, standards makers and technology companies continue to do invaluable work for projects that rely on documentation as critical digital infrastructure. Mozilla, Open Web Docs and partner organizations met in London in January 2023 to create a joint roadmap for MDN, improve planning and collaboration, and cement a shared vision for the project’s future. Working together enables us to better focus on the site’s content and usefulness. With a growing global audience of millions of developers, we see MDN as a vital resource for the web platform. It’s a place where anyone can learn about open web technologies and how to use them to build great things.",

If a Google research paper released this week is anything to go by, songwriting will be—and perhaps the music industry. The paper describes a tool called MusicLM that “can transform whistled and hummed melodies according to the style described in a text caption.” It can also generate “high-fidelity music from text descriptions such as ‘a calming violin melody backed by a distorted guitar riff.’” On the paper’s website, examples show results generated by the tool. In one instance, somebody hums “Bella Ciao,” an Italian folk song from the late 19th century. Then, based on that, the tool generates music with various instruments and styles, including guitar solo, string quartet, and jazz with saxophone. Google announces MusicLM: a model to generate music from text. Here are some crazy things it can do: 1. Given audio of a melody, it can generate new music inspired by that melody customized by prompts! Here's someone humming bella ciao turned into a cappella chorus, EDM, etc. pic.twitter.com/HKDnXI1C8U — bleedingedge.ai (@bleedingedgeai) January 27, 2023 “Whoa, this is bigger than ChatGPT to me. Google almost solved music generation, I’d say,” tweeted Keunwoo Choi, an A.I. scientist at Gaudio Lab, an A.I. audio technology company. “Think of MusicLM as the ChatGPT for music,” tweeted entrepreneur Martin Uetz, adding, “I can’t wait for this to go mainstream.” Generative A.I. vs. artists Less eager might be musicians who’ve spent decades mastering their instruments, just as illustrators and graphic artists have been angered by A.I. tools that create impressive images from mere text prompts. Among those A.I. art tools are Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and DALL-E 2. One man recently used Midjourney to illustrate a children’s book. Impressed with the tool, he shared his experience on social media—and was stunned by the backlash from illustrators. And last year, an image generated with Midjourney won a prize at an art festival, which also angered artists. The problem artists have with such tools is that they train themselves on a massive collection of digitized artworks without consent. A lawsuit recently filed in San Francisco by working artists describes Stable Diffusion and Midjourney as “collage tools that violate the rights of millions of artists.” Indeed, copyright concerns are keeping Google AI from releasing MusicLM to the public. But startups might be more willing to release such technology into the wild. Not that Big Tech isn’t also plowing resources into generative A.I. DALL-E is offered by ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Microsoft is investing billions into OpenAI and will use its technology in a wide variety of products, including the Bing search engine. That in turn has lit a fire under Google parent Alphabet, which is working on similar tools to answer the challenge. As a tool, MusicLM is far from perfect, but it hints at where things are headed. The same can be said of ChatGPT itself. As billionaire Mark Cuban recently said of the A.I. chatbot, “Imagine what GPT 10 is going to look like.” Learn how to navigate and strengthen trust in your business with The Trust Factor, a weekly newsletter examining what leaders need to succeed.

Antitrust laws are regulations that encourage competition by limiting the market power of any particular firm. This often involves ensuring that mergers and acquisitions don’t overly concentrate market power or form monopolies, as well as breaking up firms that have become monopolies. Antitrust laws also prevent multiple firms from colluding or forming a cartel to limit competition through practices such as price fixing. Due to the complexity of deciding what practices will limit competition, antitrust law has become a distinct legal specialization. Understanding Antitrust Antitrust laws are the broad group of state and federal laws that are designed to make sure businesses are competing fairly. The “trust” in antitrust refers to a group of businesses that team up or form a monopoly to dictate pricing in a particular market. Supporters say antitrust laws are necessary and that competition among sellers gives consumers lower prices, higher-quality products and services, more choices, and greater innovation. Most people agree with this concept and the benefits of an open marketplace, although there are some who claim that allowing businesses to compete as they see fit would ultimately give consumers the best prices. The Antitrust Laws The Sherman Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, and the Clayton Act are the key laws that set the groundwork for antitrust regulation. Predating the Sherman Act, the Interstate Commerce Act was also beneficial in establishing antitrust regulations, although it was less influential than some of the others. Congress passed the Interstate Commerce Act in 1887 in response to growing public demand that railroads be regulated. Among other requirements, the law ordered railroads to charge a fair fee to travelers and post those fees publicly. It was the first example of antitrust law but was less influential than the Sherman Act, passed in 1890. The Sherman Act outlawed contracts and conspiracies restraining trade and/or monopolizing industries in an attempt to stop competing individuals or businesses fixing prices, dividing markets, or attempting to rig bids. The Sherman Act laid out specific penalties and fines for violating the terms. In 1914, Congress passed the Federal Trade Commission Act, banning unfair competition methods and deceptive acts or practices. The Clayton Act was also passed in 1914, addressing specific practices that the Sherman Act does not ban. For example, the Clayton Act prohibits appointing the same person to make business decisions for competing corporations. Special Considerations The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) are tasked with enforcing federal antitrust laws. In some cases, these two authorities may also work with other regulatory agencies to ensure that certain mergers fit the public interest. The FTC mainly focuses on segments of the economy where consumer spending is high, including healthcare, drugs, food, energy, technology, and anything related to digital communications. Factors that could spark an FTC investigation include premerger notification filings, certain consumer or business correspondence, congressional inquiries, or articles on consumer or economic subjects. If the FTC thinks that a law has been violated, the agency will try to stop the questionable practices or find a resolution to the anticompetitive portion of, say, a proposed merger between two competitors. If no resolution is found, the FTC may put out an administrative complaint and/or pursue injunctive relief in federal court. The FTC might also refer evidence of criminal antitrust violations to the DOJ. The DOJ has the power to impose criminal sanctions and holds sole antitrust jurisdiction in certain sectors, such as telecommunications, banks, railroads, and airlines. Major Example of Antitrust Law In January 2023, the DOJ and eight states filed an antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet’s Google, alleging that the search giant has illegal monopolization of the digital advertising business. “Today’s complaint alleges that Google has used anticompetitive, exclusionary, and unlawful conduct to eliminate or severely diminish any threat to its dominance over digital advertising technologies,” the government agency said. The filing, which seeks to make Google divest parts of its advertising business, alleges that the company has used acquisitions as a strategy for “neutralizing or eliminating” rivals and forces advertisers to use its products by making competitors’ products difficult to use. The complaint claims that the company’s monopolistic practices curtail innovation, raise advertising fees, and prevent small businesses and publishers from growing. Google’s advertising business has come under fire from critics who argue that the search giant controls both the supply and demand sides of the digital advertising market. The company provides tools that help websites offer ad space and that assist advertisers in placing online ads. The suit alleges that Google’s dominance in the market allows it to pocket 30 cents of each dollar that advertisers spend using its suite of advertising tools. The lawsuit marks the second federal antitrust complaint against Google in three years. Under the former Trump administration, the DOJ filed a lawsuit in October 2020, accusing the tech giant of using its monopoly to reduce competition through exclusionary agreements. That case is expected to go to trial this fall. Google responded to the suit, saying the DOJ was attempting to intervene in the free market. “Today’s lawsuit from the Department of Justice attempts to pick winners and losers in the highly competitive advertising technology sector,” Google Global Ads Vice President Dan Taylor said in a statement. What are antitrust laws, and are they necessary? Antitrust laws were implemented to prevent companies from getting greedy and abusing their power. Without these regulations in place, many politicians fear that big businesses would gobble up the smaller ones. This would result in less competition and fewer choices for consumers, potentially leading to higher prices, lower quality, and less innovation, among other things. How many antitrust laws are there? There are three federal antitrust laws in effect today: the Sherman Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, and the Clayton Act. Who enforces antitrust laws? The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) are responsible for making sure that antitrust laws are abided by. The FTC mainly focuses on segments of the economy where consumer spending is high, while the DOJ holds sole antitrust jurisdiction in sectors such as telecommunications, banks, railroads, and airlines and has the power to impose criminal sanctions. The Bottom Line Antitrust laws regulate the concentration of economic power to prevent companies from price colluding or creating monopolies. Proponents of antitrust laws argue that they keep consumer prices lower and foster innovation through increased competition. Critics say antitrust regulations intervene in the free market and reduce efficiency. Antitrust laws are enforced by the FTC and DOJ, with the agencies focusing on areas of the economy that receive significant consumer spending, such as technology, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and communications. Typically, antitrust investigations arise from premerger notification filings, congressional inquiries, or consumer and business correspondence.\n\n---\n\n[2023-02-01] 2023-02-01 00:00:00\n标题: Fibe TV app Mobile Apps\n内容: Enjoy the best TV app with your Satellite TV service.

        "title": "Google created an A.I. tool that transforms hums and text into actual music: ‘This is bigger than ChatGPT to me’",
        "content": "The rapid rise of OpenAI’s artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT has left many wondering what else will be changed by generative A.I. tools. If a Google research paper released this week is anything to go by, songwriting will be—and perhaps the music industry. The paper describes a tool called MusicLM that “can transform whistled and hummed melodies according to the style described in a text caption.” It can also generate “high-fidelity music from text descriptions such as ‘a calming violin melody backed by a distorted guitar riff.’” On the paper’s website, examples show results generated by the tool. In one instance, somebody hums “Bella Ciao,” an Italian folk song from the late 19th century. Then, based on that, the tool generates music with various instruments and styles, including guitar solo, string quartet, and jazz with saxophone. Google announces MusicLM: a model to generate music from text. Here are some crazy things it can do: 1. Given audio of a melody, it can generate new music inspired by that melody customized by prompts! Here's someone humming bella ciao turned into a cappella chorus, EDM, etc. pic.twitter.com/HKDnXI1C8U — bleedingedge.ai (@bleedingedgeai) January 27, 2023 “Whoa, this is bigger than ChatGPT to me. Google almost solved music generation, I’d say,” tweeted Keunwoo Choi, an A.I. scientist at Gaudio Lab, an A.I. audio technology company. “Think of MusicLM as the ChatGPT for music,” tweeted entrepreneur Martin Uetz, adding, “I can’t wait for this to go mainstream.” Generative A.I. vs. artists Less eager might be musicians who’ve spent decades mastering their instruments, just as illustrators and graphic artists have been angered by A.I. tools that create impressive images from mere text prompts. Among those A.I. art tools are Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and DALL-E 2. One man recently used Midjourney to illustrate a children’s book. Impressed with the tool, he shared his experience on social media—and was stunned by the backlash from illustrators. And last year, an image generated with Midjourney won a prize at an art festival, which also angered artists. The problem artists have with such tools is that they train themselves on a massive collection of digitized artworks without consent. A lawsuit recently filed in San Francisco by working artists describes Stable Diffusion and Midjourney as “collage tools that violate the rights of millions of artists.” Indeed, copyright concerns are keeping Google AI from releasing MusicLM to the public. But startups might be more willing to release such technology into the wild. Not that Big Tech isn’t also plowing resources into generative A.I. DALL-E is offered by ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Microsoft is investing billions into OpenAI and will use its technology in a wide variety of products, including the Bing search engine. That in turn has lit a fire under Google parent Alphabet, which is working on similar tools to answer the challenge. As a tool, MusicLM is far from perfect, but it hints at where things are headed. The same can be said of ChatGPT itself.

        "title": "Antitrust Laws: What They Are, How They Work, Major Examples",
        "content": "What Is Antitrust? Antitrust laws are regulations that encourage competition by limiting the market power of any particular firm. This often involves ensuring that mergers and acquisitions don’t overly concentrate market power or form monopolies, as well as breaking up firms that have become monopolies. Antitrust laws also prevent multiple firms from colluding or forming a cartel to limit competition through practices such as price fixing. Due to the complexity of deciding what practices will limit competition, antitrust law has become a distinct legal specialization. Understanding Antitrust Antitrust laws are the broad group of state and federal laws that are designed to make sure businesses are competing fairly. The “trust” in antitrust refers to a group of businesses that team up or form a monopoly to dictate pricing in a particular market. Supporters say antitrust laws are necessary and that competition among sellers gives consumers lower prices, higher-quality products and services, more choices, and greater innovation. Most people agree with this concept and the benefits of an open marketplace, although there are some who claim that allowing businesses to compete as they see fit would ultimately give consumers the best prices. The Antitrust Laws The Sherman Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, and the Clayton Act are the key laws that set the groundwork for antitrust regulation. Predating the Sherman Act, the Interstate Commerce Act was also beneficial in establishing antitrust regulations, although it was less influential than some of the others. Congress passed the Interstate Commerce Act in 1887 in response to growing public demand that railroads be regulated. Among other requirements, the law ordered railroads to charge a fair fee to travelers and post those fees publicly. It was the first example of antitrust law but was less influential than the Sherman Act, passed in 1890. The Sherman Act outlawed contracts and conspiracies restraining trade and/or monopolizing industries in an attempt to stop competing individuals or businesses fixing prices, dividing markets, or attempting to rig bids. The Sherman Act laid out specific penalties and fines for violating the terms. In 1914, Congress passed the Federal Trade Commission Act, banning unfair competition methods and deceptive acts or practices. The Clayton Act was also passed in 1914, addressing specific practices that the Sherman Act does not ban. For example, the Clayton Act prohibits appointing the same person to make business decisions for competing corporations. Special Considerations The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) are tasked with enforcing federal antitrust laws. In some cases, these two authorities may also work with other regulatory agencies to ensure that certain mergers fit the public interest. The FTC mainly focuses on segments of the economy where consumer spending is high, including healthcare, drugs, food, energy, technology, and anything related to digital communications. Factors that could spark an FTC investigation include premerger notification filings, certain consumer or business correspondence, congressional inquiries, or articles on consumer or economic subjects. If the FTC thinks that a law has been violated, the agency will try to stop the questionable practices or find a resolution to the anticompetitive portion of, say, a proposed merger between two competitors. If no resolution is found, the FTC may put out an administrative complaint and/or pursue injunctive relief in federal court. The FTC might also refer evidence of criminal antitrust violations to the DOJ. The DOJ has the power to impose criminal sanctions and holds sole antitrust jurisdiction in certain sectors, such as telecommunications, banks, railroads, and airlines. Major Example of Antitrust Law In January 2023, the DOJ and eight states filed an antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet’s Google, alleging that the search giant has illegal monopolization of the digital advertising business. “Today’s complaint alleges that Google has used anticompetitive, exclusionary, and unlawful conduct to eliminate or severely diminish any threat to its dominance over digital advertising technologies,” the government agency said. The filing, which seeks to make Google divest parts of its advertising business, alleges that the company has used acquisitions as a strategy for “neutralizing or eliminating” rivals and forces advertisers to use its products by making competitors’ products difficult to use. The complaint claims that the company’s monopolistic practices curtail innovation, raise advertising fees, and prevent small businesses and publishers from growing. Google’s advertising business has come under fire from critics who argue that the search giant controls both the supply and demand sides of the digital advertising market. The company provides tools that help websites offer ad space and that assist advertisers in placing online ads. The suit alleges that Google’s dominance in the market allows it to pocket 30 cents of each dollar that advertisers spend using its suite of advertising tools. The lawsuit marks the second federal antitrust complaint against Google in three years. Under the former Trump administration, the DOJ filed a lawsuit in October 2020, accusing the tech giant of using its monopoly to reduce competition through exclusionary agreements. That case is expected to go to trial this fall. Google responded to the suit, saying the DOJ was attempting to intervene in the free market. “Today’s lawsuit from the Department of Justice attempts to pick winners and losers in the highly competitive advertising technology sector,” Google Global Ads Vice President Dan Taylor said in a statement. What are antitrust laws, and are they necessary? Antitrust laws were implemented to prevent companies from getting greedy and abusing their power. Without these regulations in place, many politicians fear that big businesses would gobble up the smaller ones. This would result in less competition and fewer choices for consumers, potentially leading to higher prices, lower quality, and less innovation, among other things. How many antitrust laws are there? There are three federal antitrust laws in effect today: the Sherman Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, and the Clayton Act. Who enforces antitrust laws? The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) are responsible for making sure that antitrust laws are abided by. The FTC mainly focuses on segments of the economy where consumer spending is high, while the DOJ holds sole antitrust jurisdiction in sectors such as telecommunications, banks, railroads, and airlines and has the power to impose criminal sanctions. The Bottom Line Antitrust laws regulate the concentration of economic power to prevent companies from price colluding or creating monopolies. Proponents of antitrust laws argue that they keep consumer prices lower and foster innovation through increased competition. Critics say antitrust regulations intervene in the free market and reduce efficiency. Antitrust laws are enforced by the FTC and DOJ, with the agencies focusing on areas of the economy that receive significant consumer spending, such as technology, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and communications. Typically, antitrust investigations arise from premerger notification filings, congressional inquiries, or consumer and business correspondence."

China commenced steps to end its zero-COVID policy — which was among the world’s harshest anti-coronavirus regimes — in December while it officially reopened its borders in early January.

Meta Platforms’ decision Wednesday to allow former President Donald Trump back onto both Facebook and Instagram threatens to undermine efforts Meta has made over the past two years to reduce the amount of political content people see in their Facebook feed. That promises to be bad for business—advertisers don’t want to be associated with a source of controversy—and it can’t help Meta in its efforts to woo people away from TikTok’s entertaining short videos. Of course, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was in a no-win situation. If Meta kept Trump off, it would face complaints from the right that it was censoring a candidate for president, an argument that is admittedly hard to refute. As Global Affairs president Nick Clegg said in tonight’s blog post, “The public should be able to hear what their politicians are saying—the good, the bad and the ugly.” Fair enough. The problem is, that’s not where Meta wants to be.\n\n---\n\n[2023-01-27] 2023-01-27 00:00:00\n标题: Niftakru fl-Olokawst: hemm bżonn ta’ dan għall-vittmi u għalina nnifisna\n内容: 27 ta' Jannar 2023 Il-bini ewlieni tal-BĊE fi Frankfurt jinsab f’sit marbut mal-atroċitajiet tal-Olokawst. Fil-Jum Internazzjonali tat-Tifkira tal-Olokawst, aħna naffermaw li t-tirannija u l-inġustizzja tal-istat qatt m’għandhom jerġgħu jipprevalu. Il-bini tal-unità Ewropea huwa l-pedament ta’ dan l-impenn. Il-bini ewlieni tal-BĊE fi Frankfurt jokkupa sit storikament sinifikanti. Huwa wieħed mill-eluf ta’ postijiet fil-Ġermanja u madwar l-Ewropa fejn ir-reġim Nażista Ġermaniż ta bidu għall-qtil ta’ miljuni ta’ membri tal-komunità Lhudija u minoritajiet oħra. Infakkru d-deportazzjonijiet u l-qtil sussegwenti b’tifkira, f’kooperazzjoni mal-Belt ta’ Frankfurt u l-Mużew Lhudi tagħha. Illum, fis-27 ta’ Jannar 2023, it-78 anniversarju mil-liberazzjoni tal-kamp ta’ konċentrament u ta’ sterminazzjoni ta’ Auschwitz, qed nikxfu wkoll plakka kommemorattiva fid-daħla tal-bini ewlieni tal-BĊE. Matul it-Tieni Gwerra Dinjija l-ibliet il-kbar kollha tal-Ġermanja organizzaw punti ta’ assemblea fejn iċ-ċittadini Lhud nġabru u ġew iddeportati. Fi Frankfurt, dan kien il-“Großmarkthalle”, il-bini tas-suq bl-ingrossa tal-belt, li llum hija parti mill-bini tal-BĊE. Fil-kantini tal-Großmarkthalle, uffiċjali Nazisti umiljaw u serqu aktar minn 10,000 ruħ, nisa, irġiel u tfal Lhud, qabel ma sfurzawhom fuq ferroviji li marru lejn il-ghettos, kampijiet ta’ konċentrament u kampijiet ta’ sterminazzjoni, sabiex jinqatlu. Ftit biss baqgħu ħajjin. Iddisinjat mill-perit Martin Elsaesser u tlesta fl-1928, il-Großmarkthalle kien bini partikolarment modern, qabel żmienu f’ħafna modi. Magħruf lokalment bħala l-“Gemieskirch” (knisja tal-ħaxix), il-prodotti friski kienu jinbiegħu hawnhekk lill-bejjiegħa bl-imnut. Jinsab fin-nofs taż-żona ta’ Ostend ta’ Frankfurt il-Großmarkthalle għandu konnessjonijiet tat-trasport eċċellenti. Qiegħda nagħmel dan il-punt għaliex dan il-bini kien intgħażel b’attenzjoni. Il-linji ferrovjarji li jwasslu għal Theresienstadt, Łódź, Minsk, Kaunas, Izbica, Raasiku, Majdanek u Sobibór bdew hawn. Total ta’ għaxar trasportazzjonijiet kbar telqu lejn il-kampijiet ta’ konċentrament u ta’ sterminazzjoni minn Frankfurt bejn Ottubru 1941 u Settembru 1942. Sal-15 ta’ Marzu 1945 kien hemm ukoll diversi deportazzjonijiet iżgħar lejn Auschwitz, Buchenwald u Theresienstadt. Il-biċċa l-kbira ta’ dawn it-trasportazzjonijiet iżgħar bdew mill-Istazzjon Ewlieni ta’ Frankfurt jew minn Frankfurt-Lvant, li jinsab qrib il-Großmarkthalle. Għal dan il-għan, il-Gestapo kriet il-kantina tal-Großmarkthalle għal ftit jiem mill-Belt ta’ Frankfurt, għal żmien twil biżżejjed biex tagħmel deportazzjoni, filwaqt li l-bejgħ tal-frott u l-ħaxix kompla ftit ’il fuq. Il-Großmarkthalle kien fil-fatt post pubbliku ħafna. Il deportazzjoni tal-Lhud – bħat-tneħħija tal-vot tagħhom u l-oppressjoni fis-snin ta’ qabel – ma seħħx b’mod sigriet. Il-vittmi ta’ spiss kienu mżebilħin minn dawk li kienu għaddejjin fi triqithom ’il barra miċ-ċentru tal-belt. Imbagħad, fil-kantina ta’ Großmarkthalle, il-vittmi tteħdulhom l-oġġetti ta’ valur u ċ-ċwievet tad-djar tagħhom, f’waħda biss minn sensiela ta’ passi ta’ żebliħ f’dan il-proċess umiljanti. Biex tiżdied il-ħruxija f’dan il-kalvarju tagħhom, huma saħansitra kellhom iħallsu n-noll tal-ferrovija għall-vjaġġ tagħhom lejn il-ghettos, il-kampijiet ta’ konċentrament u kampijiet ta’ sterminazzjoni. Imbagħad jew iddaħħlu bħal xi merħla direttament fuq il-ferroviji jew kellhom jqattgħu l-lejl fil-kantina, f’kundizzjonijiet terribbli. Il-monument fi u madwar il-bini tal-BĊE jirrintraċċa din it-triq orribbli ta’ tbatija. Illum, hekk kif nikxfu plakka ta’ tifkira addizzjonali, kelli l-privileġġ li niltaqa’ ma’ Edith Erbrich. Meta Edith kellha sebgħa snin, in-Nazisti ordnaw li, flimkien ma’ missierha u oħtha, jiġu ddeportati. Dan kien fl-14 ta’ Frar 1945, inqas minn tliet xhur qabel it-tmiem tal-gwerra, li huwa dak li salvalha ħajjitha. Ommha, li ma kinitx Lhudija, ma tħallietx takkumpanja lill-familja tagħha. Edith tilfet lin-nannu tagħha fil-kamp, iżda missierha u oħtha reġgħu lura magħha għand ommha. Huma kienu l-eċċezzjoni: minn aktar minn 10,000 deportat, ftit biss salvaw. Madankollu, hi kemm hi ta’ dwejjaq din il-parti tal-istorja ta’ Edith, huwa inkoraġġanti li dak li jkun ikun jaf kif kompliet il-ħajja tagħha.

As part of my reporting, I confirmed that Meta let its Black Gaming Creators Program, a $10 million fund, sunset at the end of last year. That brings up an important question of how successful this fund and others like it have been in supporting Black creators. Former participants of the Black Gaming Creators Program told me there were several problems with the program. As with other creators paid by Facebook to stream, creators in the Black gaming program complained of delayed payments. Facebook Gaming’s dashboards sometimes miscounted the number of hours creators streamed, which meant creators had to wait an additional 30 days to be paid their monthly stipend. Meta said a small cohort of creators were impacted by such reporting issues, which were resolved. Specific to the diversity-focused program, creators said it was sometimes difficult to get hold of a representative inside Meta to push the mission of the program. Meta had developed the program to help Black gamers become full-time streamers, announcing it during a period of increased attention to systemic racism following the death of George Floyd.\n\n---\n\n[2023-02-01] 2023-02-01 00:00:00\n标题: Meta's Revenue Beats, Boosts Buybacks\n内容: Bloomberg Technology Reporter Alex Barinka breaks down Meta Platforms earnings and outlook, including a $40 billion boost in share buyback authorization.

However, the combination of technical activity and analysts' sentiment had the stock in a rebound from 7-year lows, which was confirmed by the Q4 results. The question now is if this will be a Vee-shaped recovery for the stock or if there is something more investors should be prepared for. The key takeaway from Facebook's report isn't that business us good; it's that it isn't getting any worse, which is enough for the market right now. Add in the new catchphrase, \"the year of efficiency\", and the stage is set for a larger recovery in share prices, but now it's time for the company to prove itself. Get Meta Platforms alerts: Facebook Pops On Mixed Results Facebook reported what can only be called a mixed quarter and is mixed in ways unfavorable to higher share prices. The revenue of $32.17 billion beat the consensus estimate by $0.480 billion, which is good, but the margin of outperformance is slim; revenue is down 4.5% from last year, and margins contracted severely. Also mixed was news about DAP/MAPs and DAU/MAUs. The number of daily and monthly users rose in all metrics but did not result in an increase in revenue or aid the margin. Margins are impacted by restructuring, so that must be factored in, but a restructuring does little to improve the company's ability to monetize its traffic, only its costs. Regarding the earnings, the company reported $1.76 in GAAP earnings, which fell nearly 50% YOY and missed the Marketbeat.com consensus estimate by almost $0.50. The good news is that capital plans are still in effect, share repurchases have been increased, and strategies for \"efficiency\" are in the works, but these earnings are still very poor. The company will regain some margin as restructuring costs diminish, but how much and will it be able to improve monetization? Turning to the guidance, this news is also very mixed. Again, the good news is that guidance is as expected, but the bad news is that it's only as expected, and the bottom line is getting aided by a reduction in CAP-EX.

And you can invest in Autonomix ahead of their intended Nasdaq listing.* *Disclosure: This is a paid advertisement for Autonomix’s Regulation A+ Offering. Please read the offering circular at invest.autonomix.com Invest in Autonomix today. This raises the question of how efficiency will impact the company's future. Saving money now is good, but foregoing reinvestment could hamper profitability in the future. And then there is the new repurchase plan. $40 billion in repurchases will help support price action, but could this money be spent in better ways? Bottom line, Meta's results and plans are what the market needed to hear, but they may not be enough to sustain a prolonged rally just yet, even if share prices move higher today. The Analysts Are Pushing The Stock Higher The analysts are pushing this stock higher so Meta stock could be expected to rally another potential 30%. There have been at least 22 commentaries released since the report was issued all including a price target reduction and three come with upgrades. The consensus price target is now at $199, which is up in the one and 3-month comparison but still below a potentially strong level of resistance. Since this stock has not yet had a major correction since the rebound began, investors should expect one to come. It may not happen at the $180 level, but it should be expected to begin at the $200 level if not sooner. In addition, the stock is already up a solid 100% since hitting its bottom, which is an attractive trigger for profit-taking. Looking at the chart, the question is whether this is a VEE-bottom. If it is, the market should plow right through the $180 level on its way to $200, and then that barrier should fall fairly quickly. If not, the market should expect a double-bottom or even a head & shoulders to form, and those could take several quarters to play out and could even hit new lows before a rally truly takes hold.

        "title": "Trump’s Meta Return; Massage Therapists, Matthew McConaughey and Elon Musk",
        "content": "So much for Facebook’s efforts to become less political. Meta Platforms’ decision Wednesday to allow former President Donald Trump back onto both Facebook and Instagram threatens to undermine efforts Meta has made over the past two years to reduce the amount of political content people see in their Facebook feed. That promises to be bad for business—advertisers don’t want to be associated with a source of controversy—and it can’t help Meta in its efforts to woo people away from TikTok’s entertaining short videos. Of course, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was in a no-win situation. If Meta kept Trump off, it would face complaints from the right that it was censoring a candidate for president, an argument that is admittedly hard to refute. As Global Affairs president Nick Clegg said in tonight’s blog post, “The public should be able to hear what their politicians are saying—the good, the bad and the ugly.” Fair enough. The problem is, that’s not where Meta wants to be."

        "content": "27 ta' Jannar 2023 Il-bini ewlieni tal-BĊE fi Frankfurt jinsab f’sit marbut mal-atroċitajiet tal-Olokawst. Fil-Jum Internazzjonali tat-Tifkira tal-Olokawst, aħna naffermaw li t-tirannija u l-inġustizzja tal-istat qatt m’għandhom jerġgħu jipprevalu. Il-bini tal-unità Ewropea huwa l-pedament ta’ dan l-impenn. Il-bini ewlieni tal-BĊE fi Frankfurt jokkupa sit storikament sinifikanti. Huwa wieħed mill-eluf ta’ postijiet fil-Ġermanja u madwar l-Ewropa fejn ir-reġim Nażista Ġermaniż ta bidu għall-qtil ta’ miljuni ta’ membri tal-komunità Lhudija u minoritajiet oħra. Infakkru d-deportazzjonijiet u l-qtil sussegwenti b’tifkira, f’kooperazzjoni mal-Belt ta’ Frankfurt u l-Mużew Lhudi tagħha. Illum, fis-27 ta’ Jannar 2023, it-78 anniversarju mil-liberazzjoni tal-kamp ta’ konċentrament u ta’ sterminazzjoni ta’ Auschwitz, qed nikxfu wkoll plakka kommemorattiva fid-daħla tal-bini ewlieni tal-BĊE. Matul it-Tieni Gwerra Dinjija l-ibliet il-kbar kollha tal-Ġermanja organizzaw punti ta’ assemblea fejn iċ-ċittadini Lhud nġabru u ġew iddeportati. Fi Frankfurt, dan kien il-“Großmarkthalle”, il-bini tas-suq bl-ingrossa tal-belt, li llum hija parti mill-bini tal-BĊE. Fil-kantini tal-Großmarkthalle, uffiċjali Nazisti umiljaw u serqu aktar minn 10,000 ruħ, nisa, irġiel u tfal Lhud, qabel ma sfurzawhom fuq ferroviji li marru lejn il-ghettos, kampijiet ta’ konċentrament u kampijiet ta’ sterminazzjoni, sabiex jinqatlu. Ftit biss baqgħu ħajjin. Iddisinjat mill-perit Martin Elsaesser u tlesta fl-1928, il-Großmarkthalle kien bini partikolarment modern, qabel żmienu f’ħafna modi. Magħruf lokalment bħala l-“Gemieskirch” (knisja tal-ħaxix), il-prodotti friski kienu jinbiegħu hawnhekk lill-bejjiegħa bl-imnut. Jinsab fin-nofs taż-żona ta’ Ostend ta’ Frankfurt il-Großmarkthalle għandu konnessjonijiet tat-trasport eċċellenti. Qiegħda nagħmel dan il-punt għaliex dan il-bini kien intgħażel b’attenzjoni. Il-linji ferrovjarji li jwasslu għal Theresienstadt, Łódź, Minsk, Kaunas, Izbica, Raasiku, Majdanek u Sobibór bdew hawn. Total ta’ għaxar trasportazzjonijiet kbar telqu lejn il-kampijiet ta’ konċentrament u ta’ sterminazzjoni minn Frankfurt bejn Ottubru 1941 u Settembru 1942. Sal-15 ta’ Marzu 1945 kien hemm ukoll diversi deportazzjonijiet iżgħar lejn Auschwitz, Buchenwald u Theresienstadt. Il-biċċa l-kbira ta’ dawn it-trasportazzjonijiet iżgħar bdew mill-Istazzjon Ewlieni ta’ Frankfurt jew minn Frankfurt-Lvant, li jinsab qrib il-Großmarkthalle. Għal dan il-għan, il-Gestapo kriet il-kantina tal-Großmarkthalle għal ftit jiem mill-Belt ta’ Frankfurt, għal żmien twil biżżejjed biex tagħmel deportazzjoni, filwaqt li l-bejgħ tal-frott u l-ħaxix kompla ftit ’il fuq. Il-Großmarkthalle kien fil-fatt post pubbliku ħafna. Il deportazzjoni tal-Lhud – bħat-tneħħija tal-vot tagħhom u l-oppressjoni fis-snin ta’ qabel – ma seħħx b’mod sigriet. Il-vittmi ta’ spiss kienu mżebilħin minn dawk li kienu għaddejjin fi triqithom ’il barra miċ-ċentru tal-belt. Imbagħad, fil-kantina ta’ Großmarkthalle, il-vittmi tteħdulhom l-oġġetti ta’ valur u ċ-ċwievet tad-djar tagħhom, f’waħda biss minn sensiela ta’ passi ta’ żebliħ f’dan il-proċess umiljanti. Biex tiżdied il-ħruxija f’dan il-kalvarju tagħhom, huma saħansitra kellhom iħallsu n-noll tal-ferrovija għall-vjaġġ tagħhom lejn il-ghettos, il-kampijiet ta’ konċentrament u kampijiet ta’ sterminazzjoni. Imbagħad jew iddaħħlu bħal xi merħla direttament fuq il-ferroviji jew kellhom jqattgħu l-lejl fil-kantina, f’kundizzjonijiet terribbli. Il-monument fi u madwar il-bini tal-BĊE jirrintraċċa din it-triq orribbli ta’ tbatija. Illum, hekk kif nikxfu plakka ta’ tifkira addizzjonali, kelli l-privileġġ li niltaqa’ ma’ Edith Erbrich. Meta Edith kellha sebgħa snin, in-Nazisti ordnaw li, flimkien ma’ missierha u oħtha, jiġu ddeportati. Dan kien fl-14 ta’ Frar 1945, inqas minn tliet xhur qabel it-tmiem tal-gwerra, li huwa dak li salvalha ħajjitha. Ommha, li ma kinitx Lhudija, ma tħallietx takkumpanja lill-familja tagħha. Edith tilfet lin-nannu tagħha fil-kamp, iżda missierha u oħtha reġgħu lura magħha għand ommha. Huma kienu l-eċċezzjoni: minn aktar minn 10,000 deportat, ftit biss salvaw. Madankollu, hi kemm hi ta’ dwejjaq din il-parti tal-istorja ta’ Edith, huwa inkoraġġanti li dak li jkun ikun jaf kif kompliet il-ħajja tagħha. Edith baqgħet mal-familja tagħha fi Frankfurt, ħadmet hawn, iżżewwġet u għexet ħajja sħiħa. Ftit tas-snin ilu, bdiet tirrakkonta l-istorja tagħha fl-iskejjel u f’avvenimenti pubbliċi. Hija għamlet dan ħafna drabi għalina wkoll, u jiena kburija u grata meta ngħid li Edith Erbrich saret ħabiba tal-BĊE. Għaliex it-tifkira hi tant importanti għalina?

The revenue of $32.17 billion beat the consensus estimate by $0.480 billion, which is good, but the margin of outperformance is slim; revenue is down 4.5% from last year, and margins contracted severely. Also mixed was news about DAP/MAPs and DAU/MAUs. The number of daily and monthly users rose in all metrics but did not result in an increase in revenue or aid the margin. Margins are impacted by restructuring, so that must be factored in, but a restructuring does little to improve the company's ability to monetize its traffic, only its costs. Regarding the earnings, the company reported $1.76 in GAAP earnings, which fell nearly 50% YOY and missed the Marketbeat.com consensus estimate by almost $0.50. The good news is that capital plans are still in effect, share repurchases have been increased, and strategies for \"efficiency\" are in the works, but these earnings are still very poor. The company will regain some margin as restructuring costs diminish, but how much and will it be able to improve monetization? Turning to the guidance, this news is also very mixed. Again, the good news is that guidance is as expected, but the bad news is that it's only as expected, and the bottom line is getting aided by a reduction in CAP-EX. Ad Autonomix [Investor Alert] Potential Breakthrough Medical Tech Investment Opportunity Autonomix has patented technology that can detect and target nerve signals at an accuracy never seen before, a $100B opportunity. Now the team with almost $600M in exits is planning to list Autonomix on the Nasdaq. And you can invest in Autonomix ahead of their intended Nasdaq listing.* *Disclosure: This is a paid advertisement for Autonomix’s Regulation A+ Offering. Please read the offering circular at invest.autonomix.com Invest in Autonomix today. This raises the question of how efficiency will impact the company's future. Saving money now is good, but foregoing reinvestment could hamper profitability in the future. And then there is the new repurchase plan. $40 billion in repurchases will help support price action, but could this money be spent in better ways? Bottom line, Meta's results and plans are what the market needed to hear, but they may not be enough to sustain a prolonged rally just yet, even if share prices move higher today. The Analysts Are Pushing The Stock Higher The analysts are pushing this stock higher so Meta stock could be expected to rally another potential 30%. There have been at least 22 commentaries released since the report was issued all including a price target reduction and three come with upgrades. The consensus price target is now at $199, which is up in the one and 3-month comparison but still below a potentially strong level of resistance. Since this stock has not yet had a major correction since the rebound began, investors should expect one to come. It may not happen at the $180 level, but it should be expected to begin at the $200 level if not sooner. In addition, the stock is already up a solid 100% since hitting its bottom, which is an attractive trigger for profit-taking. Looking at the chart, the question is whether this is a VEE-bottom. If it is, the market should plow right through the $180 level on its way to $200, and then that barrier should fall fairly quickly. If not, the market should expect a double-bottom or even a head & shoulders to form, and those could take several quarters to play out and could even hit new lows before a rally truly takes hold.

Instagram had recently been building a new hub in the U.K., where its engineering and product teams are based, but is now asking workers to move to the U.S., bringing it back under centralized control, Financial Times reports. Mosseri moved from California to London less than eight months ago. Meta proposes to base Instagram primarily in New York, where it already has large teams of staff who work on engaging with the platform's content creators. London was Instagram's first international office, established in 2013. In 2022, the city was Meta's most extensive global engineering base outside the U.S., with about 4,000 staff. Since then, Meta has shared plans to axe over 20,000 jobs. Mosseri's ambitions for London, where he anticipated building a large team with several layers of seniority in the city, have been crushed by Meta's cost-cutting. As Zuckerberg slashed jobs, explicitly targeting \"middle managers . . . to make decisions faster\", the Instagram team was sporadically restructured and often reported back to the U.S. for instructions.

The feature is a one-to-all tool allowing users to quickly disseminate news to others. According to a WaBetaInfo report, the social messaging app may bring the new feature with a future update. Earlier the feature was rumoured to come for Android devices, but thanks to the latest WhatsApp beta for iOS 23.8.0.75, it is now known that WhatsApp is working on Channels for iPhone users as well. Sharing a screenshot of the upcoming feature, the report says that WhatsApp plans to rename the Status tab to ‘Updates’ as channels. WhatsApp channels will listed within this section of the app. As mentioned before, a WhatsApp Channel is a private tool where phone numbers and user information joining a channel are always kept hidden. However, unlike individual chats, messages received within a channel will not be end-to-end encrypted. This is because the concept of one-to-many wouldn’t make much sense for channels. However, the end-to-end encryption of private messaging will not be impacted. The WaBetaInfo report says that users will have control over which channels they want to subscribe to, and no one else can see whom they follow, regardless of whether they’ve added them as contacts or not. Additionally, people won’t get auto-subscribed to channels as there are no algorithmic recommendations or social graphs pushing content to users that they didn’t choose to see. WhatsApp Channels will also support handles allowing users to search a specific WhatsApp channel by simply entering its username within WhatsApp. The feature, the report says, is designed to improve the accessibility of channels, making it easier for users to get updates that they prefer. Channels for WhatsApp are under development. It is likely to be released with a future update.\n\n---\n\n[2023-04-25] 2023-04-25 14:33:08\n标题: After Meta, Twitter, American conglomerate 3M joins the layoff drive, likely to cut about 6,000 positions globally\n内容: The move comes as consumers are cutting back on discretionary spending as a series of interest rate hikes over the past year to bring down stubbornly high inflation have stoked fears of an economic downturn.

The company, known for its business in the fields of industry, worker safety, healthcare, and consumer goods, said on Tuesday it would cut about 6,000 positions globally as the US industrial conglomerate looks to focus on high-growth businesses, including automotive electrification and home improvement.

The decline was not completely unexpected, however, given the limited number of vendors in the market, a challenging macro-economic environment, and a lack of mass market adoption from consumers. The results for 2022 were also hindered by difficult comparisons to the prior year, when the market was bolstered by Meta's Quest 2 and strong spending by consumers stuck at home with disposable income for entertainment. As the Quest 2 approached its two-year anniversary and as global economies opened up, consumer and business spending shifted away from AR and VR headsets leading to the decline in 2022. Despite the downturn, the overall market was led by Meta with nearly 80% share. In second place was ByteDance (Pico) with 10% share as the company continued to ramp up its product portfolio and focus on markets where Meta was notably absent or a lesser known brand. The remaining top 5 spots were held by DPVR, HTC, and iQIYI. One other notable company was Nreal who captured the sixth position amongst AR/VR headsets but held the top spot in the AR market by shipping nearly 100K units over the course of 2022. \"While Meta and ByteDance duke it out in the VR segment, Nreal has been able to slowly grow its presence by appealing to mobile gamers,\" said Jitesh Ubrani, research manager, Mobility and Consumer Device Trackers at IDC. \"Though it's still early days for AR and VR, Meta has been able to build a moat for itself through its various first- and third-party content. This is where other players such as Sony and potentially Apple can provide meaningful competition though in the long run it'll put pressure on others including ByteDance and Nreal.\" \"Another area that is slowly gaining attention is mixed reality – devices that can switch between augmented and virtual reality,\" added Ramon T. Llamas, research director for Mobile Devices and AR/VR at IDC. \"The release of the Meta Quest Pro last fall and the announcement of HTC's XE Elite earlier this year demonstrate clear innovation as to what is possible for the ARVR market, and it should not be difficult to imagine others following suit. Moreover, commercial users with multiple use cases – ranging from on-boarding and orientation to training and collaboration – may gravitate to its appeal. However, given the still low penetration of AR and VR into the market, it may take several cycles for mixed reality headsets to gain salience.\" About IDC Trackers IDC Tracker products provide accurate and timely market size, vendor share, and forecasts for hundreds of technology markets from more than 100 countries around the globe.

That label might have made sense (at least to him) back at the height of the boom times, in the fall of 2021, when his focus was all metaverse, all the time. The Facebook brand felt a little tarnished by various misinformation dramas. But it’s a different world now. Zuckerberg has embraced efficiency (hence the second round of job cuts in five months), as well as tech’s latest buzzy concept, generative AI. If Zuckerberg really wants to be in the cool club, he could adopt AI Platforms as the company’s new moniker. But a better idea would be to switch back to Facebook. After all, as Facebook app head Tom Alison pointed out in a blog post on Tuesday, “Facebook is not dead nor dying, but in fact alive and thriving with 2 billion daily active users.” That’s a very good point. It’s easy to forget that Meta’s flagship app remains incredibly popular with ordinary people around the world—and a key part of a hugely profitable app business. Sure, the app isn’t growing much anymore and its users are trending older. In that sense, it’s like the CBS television network, which is not hip and is popular mostly with older people, particularly in the middle of the country. But that’s not nothing. Lots of companies would kill for CBS’ reach. And the same is even more true of Facebook.\n\n---\n\n[2023-03-10] 2023-03-10 06:17:00\n标题: Facebook Parent Building Decentralized Text-Based Social Network, Challenging Elon Musk's Twitter\n内容: Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. META is reportedly developing a new app focused on text-based content that will support ActivityPub — a decentralized social networking protocol also used by Mastodon and other Twitter competitors. What Happened: Meta is currently in the initial stages of creating the app that will enable users to share text-based updates, in what could be a direct competition to Elon Musk’s Twitter. See Also: Zuckerberg Announces Subscription Service For Meta's Facebook And Instagram, Elon Musk Has 1 Word To Say About It Meta revealed, in an email to Platformer, that it was “exploring a standalone decentralized social network for sharing text updates.” The app, codenamed P92, will permit users to log in using their current Meta-owned Instagram credentials. The product is still in its early stages and no release date has been announced. Though details are scant, the Platformer report, citing sources, stated that Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, is leading the development of the project. The most notable aspect of this project is Meta’s plans to create a decentralized network. In such a network, users usually can set up their independent servers and establish server-specific content moderation rules. By building a decentralized network, Meta could also enable this app to interface with other social products, stated Platformer. Why It’s Important: As Twitter grapples with chaos under Musk's leadership, tech companies are taking notice of the growing trend of users seeking alternative platforms. In line with this, Instagram introduced a new feature in December 2022 called ‘Notes,’ which enables users to share brief text and emoji-based posts of up to 60 characters.

It looks to refocus on its core business, the Wall Street Journal reports citing familiar sources. In February 2022, Meta completed its acquisition of Kustomer in a deal worth $1 billion. Also Read: 3 ETFs May Bear The Brunt Of Meta’s Decisions, From Layoffs To Price Cuts Kustomer builds software to manage customer messages from multiple services on one central dashboard. Meta expected the acquisition to enable businesses to use its WhatsApp and Messenger apps for customer service. Since the deal’s closing, Kustomer has burned through around $200 million between its operation and one-time expenses. “In light of Meta’s efficiency efforts, we’ve decided to focus on our fastest-growing business messaging offerings, including the monetization opportunity for WhatsApp,” said Ryan Moore, a spokesman for Meta. At one point, Meta contemplated selling the business outright before planning to keep a small stake in Kustomer. In the planned divestiture, Kustomer’s valuation will likely be a small fraction of what Meta paid, reflecting the company’s recent financial performance. Kustomer founders Brad Birnbaum and Jeremy Suriel have contacted venture firms to raise money to buy back the business and fund losses. Since Kustomer’s acquisition, its compensation costs have far outstripped that of peer customer service companies. Price Action: META shares traded higher by 1.08% at $181.44 in the premarket on the last check Monday.\n\n---\n\n[2023-03-14] 2023-03-14 00:00:00\n标题: Ghost Broking Accounts for Third of Insurance Fraud Investigations\n内容: (Insurance Post) - Ghost broking now makes up over a third of the cases being investigated by City of London Police, and there has been a surge in the number of scammers using Instagram to try and con consumers.

Ghost broking now makes up over a third of the cases being investigated by City of London Police, and there has been a surge in the number of scammers using Instagram to try and con consumers. While in the past there have been complaints about the time social media giants take to remove suspect adverts, detective chief inspector Tom Hill, pictured, who leads the police force’s Insurance Fraud Enforcement Department, said Meta, owner of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has upped its game when it comes to pulling posts. He said: “We get a pretty good response with Meta. With ghost brokers, we see a lot of adverts on Instagram. Clearly, it has got lots of competing priorities, not just insurance fraud. We can access social media platforms, and website providers, to take down profiles and adverts quite quickly, so we have seen an improvement. “There is a way to go. I would love to see much closer working with social media companies, which hopefully we will get to in the future.” When asked if Meta was willing to work with Ifed to improve its checks before allowing profiles and adverts to be posted, such as checking the Financial Conduct Authority’s register to ensure individuals claiming to be insurance brokers are regulated, DCI Hill said: “We haven’t formally given any training, but we absolutely would. “The Online Safety Bill comes through in May and that makes it clear that more engagement is needed between law enforcement and social media companies in relation to that legislation.” A Meta spokesperson said the social media giant does not allow fraudulent activity and quickly removes accounts that violate policies “when it becomes aware”. They said: “We work closely with law enforcement to support investigations and keep scammers off our platforms and continue to invest heavily in safety and security. “We also joined Stop Scams UK to help remove scams at the source. We encourage people to report activity like this to us and the police, so we can take action.” Meta recently started rolling out a process that requires financial services advertisers targeting users in the UK to be authorised by the FCA. On the number of ghost brokers trying to scam consumers and businesses in the current climate, DCI Hill said: “It is still a significant issue and I think that online disruption element, to stop people falling victim to it, is really important. “We have an operation called Operation Mirage, which is our online disruption capability to take out profiles and give some guidance so insurers can report profiles and websites straight into us, so we can take action against them in a timely way.” Opportunity knocks Hill said his team is focused on opportunistic fraud, as it expects an increase in that type of activity due to the cost-of-living crisis. When asked what more could the industry do to prevent and tackle this type of fraud, Hill said: “The fraud community within the industry works closely with us and the Insurance Fraud Bureau. I think that is really good. We would always love more due diligence around policies and claims, but I think there is a commercial reality to this that I am aware of, and alive to. “I wouldn’t want to preach and tell them what they should be doing. We always advocate early referrals into us so we can – even if we can’t prosecute a case – disrupt an organised crime group that is targeting a certain fraud trend, or company, or series of companies.” In 2021, Insurance Post reported the number of ghost broking investigations had doubled since 2016. In February 2021, Ifed said that throughout 2020, Action Fraud, the national fraud and cyber-crime centre, received 694 reports of ghost broking – nearly a 10% increase on 2019. At one end of the ghost broking spectrum are individuals marketing themselves through social media or by word of mouth, who set up policies using real or amended information, or sell entirely fake policies. At the other end, are individuals who are part of organised criminal gangs, who will arrange policies on behalf of criminals with a view to allowing them to drive vehicles they wouldn’t otherwise be able to use.

        "title": "Global Shipments of AR/VR Headsets Decline Sharply in 2022 Following the Prior Year's Strong Results, According to IDC",
        "content": "The pendulum for AR/VR headsets swung the other way through the course of 2022 as global shipments declined 20.9% year over year to 8.8 million units, according to new data from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Augmented and Virtual Reality Headset Tracker. The decline was not completely unexpected, however, given the limited number of vendors in the market, a challenging macro-economic environment, and a lack of mass market adoption from consumers. The results for 2022 were also hindered by difficult comparisons to the prior year, when the market was bolstered by Meta's Quest 2 and strong spending by consumers stuck at home with disposable income for entertainment. As the Quest 2 approached its two-year anniversary and as global economies opened up, consumer and business spending shifted away from AR and VR headsets leading to the decline in 2022. Despite the downturn, the overall market was led by Meta with nearly 80% share. In second place was ByteDance (Pico) with 10% share as the company continued to ramp up its product portfolio and focus on markets where Meta was notably absent or a lesser known brand. The remaining top 5 spots were held by DPVR, HTC, and iQIYI. One other notable company was Nreal who captured the sixth position amongst AR/VR headsets but held the top spot in the AR market by shipping nearly 100K units over the course of 2022. \"While Meta and ByteDance duke it out in the VR segment, Nreal has been able to slowly grow its presence by appealing to mobile gamers,\" said Jitesh Ubrani, research manager, Mobility and Consumer Device Trackers at IDC. \"Though it's still early days for AR and VR, Meta has been able to build a moat for itself through its various first- and third-party content. This is where other players such as Sony and potentially Apple can provide meaningful competition though in the long run it'll put pressure on others including ByteDance and Nreal.\" \"Another area that is slowly gaining attention is mixed reality – devices that can switch between augmented and virtual reality,\" added Ramon T. Llamas, research director for Mobile Devices and AR/VR at IDC. \"The release of the Meta Quest Pro last fall and the announcement of HTC's XE Elite earlier this year demonstrate clear innovation as to what is possible for the ARVR market, and it should not be difficult to imagine others following suit. Moreover, commercial users with multiple use cases – ranging from on-boarding and orientation to training and collaboration – may gravitate to its appeal. However, given the still low penetration of AR and VR into the market, it may take several cycles for mixed reality headsets to gain salience.\" About IDC Trackers IDC Tracker products provide accurate and timely market size, vendor share, and forecasts for hundreds of technology markets from more than 100 countries around the globe.

        "title": "To Prove Efficiency, Zuckerberg Should Reverse Name Change",
        "content": "Here’s an idea for Meta Platforms as we wait for the company to unveil another round of layoffs: Mark Zuckerberg should reverse his decision to change the name of the company to Meta. That label might have made sense (at least to him) back at the height of the boom times, in the fall of 2021, when his focus was all metaverse, all the time. The Facebook brand felt a little tarnished by various misinformation dramas. But it’s a different world now. Zuckerberg has embraced efficiency (hence the second round of job cuts in five months), as well as tech’s latest buzzy concept, generative AI. If Zuckerberg really wants to be in the cool club, he could adopt AI Platforms as the company’s new moniker. But a better idea would be to switch back to Facebook. After all, as Facebook app head Tom Alison pointed out in a blog post on Tuesday, “Facebook is not dead nor dying, but in fact alive and thriving with 2 billion daily active users.” That’s a very good point. It’s easy to forget that Meta’s flagship app remains incredibly popular with ordinary people around the world—and a key part of a hugely profitable app business. Sure, the app isn’t growing much anymore and its users are trending older. In that sense, it’s like the CBS television network, which is not hip and is popular mostly with older people, particularly in the middle of the country. But that’s not nothing. Lots of companies would kill for CBS’ reach. And the same is even more true of Facebook."

        "content": "Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. META is reportedly developing a new app focused on text-based content that will support ActivityPub — a decentralized social networking protocol also used by Mastodon and other Twitter competitors. What Happened: Meta is currently in the initial stages of creating the app that will enable users to share text-based updates, in what could be a direct competition to Elon Musk’s Twitter. See Also: Zuckerberg Announces Subscription Service For Meta's Facebook And Instagram, Elon Musk Has 1 Word To Say About It Meta revealed, in an email to Platformer, that it was “exploring a standalone decentralized social network for sharing text updates.” The app, codenamed P92, will permit users to log in using their current Meta-owned Instagram credentials. The product is still in its early stages and no release date has been announced. Though details are scant, the Platformer report, citing sources, stated that Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, is leading the development of the project. The most notable aspect of this project is Meta’s plans to create a decentralized network. In such a network, users usually can set up their independent servers and establish server-specific content moderation rules. By building a decentralized network, Meta could also enable this app to interface with other social products, stated Platformer. Why It’s Important: As Twitter grapples with chaos under Musk's leadership, tech companies are taking notice of the growing trend of users seeking alternative platforms. In line with this, Instagram introduced a new feature in December 2022 called ‘Notes,’ which enables users to share brief text and emoji-based posts of up to 60 characters.

        "content": "Meta Platforms, Inc META weighed strategic alternatives for customer service company Kustomer. It looks to refocus on its core business, the Wall Street Journal reports citing familiar sources. In February 2022, Meta completed its acquisition of Kustomer in a deal worth $1 billion. Also Read: 3 ETFs May Bear The Brunt Of Meta’s Decisions, From Layoffs To Price Cuts Kustomer builds software to manage customer messages from multiple services on one central dashboard. Meta expected the acquisition to enable businesses to use its WhatsApp and Messenger apps for customer service. Since the deal’s closing, Kustomer has burned through around $200 million between its operation and one-time expenses. “In light of Meta’s efficiency efforts, we’ve decided to focus on our fastest-growing business messaging offerings, including the monetization opportunity for WhatsApp,” said Ryan Moore, a spokesman for Meta. At one point, Meta contemplated selling the business outright before planning to keep a small stake in Kustomer. In the planned divestiture, Kustomer’s valuation will likely be a small fraction of what Meta paid, reflecting the company’s recent financial performance. Kustomer founders Brad Birnbaum and Jeremy Suriel have contacted venture firms to raise money to buy back the business and fund losses. Since Kustomer’s acquisition, its compensation costs have far outstripped that of peer customer service companies. Price Action: META shares traded higher by 1.08% at $181.44 in the premarket on the last check Monday."

Maddie Meyer Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) was one of the top performing biotech stocks during the 2020 COVID-19 wave that sent many soaring to the moon.

An In-Depth Exploration\"\n内容: Value-focused investors continuously seek stocks priced below their intrinsic value. One such stock that warrants attention is Moderna Inc (MRNA, Financial). Currently priced at 77.53, the stock recorded an 8.84% gain in a day and a 3-month decrease of 28.34%. The GF Value of the stock is estimated at $112.71. However, despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Moderna should not be overlooked. An Overview of the GF Value The GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock, derived from our unique methodology. The GF Value Line on our summary page provides a snapshot of the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded. This calculation is based on three key factors: Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio, and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) at which the stock has traded. GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth. Future estimates of business performance. If the stock price significantly deviates from the GF Value Line, it indicates potential overvaluation or undervaluation, which could impact future returns. Deciphering Moderna's Risk Factors Despite Moderna's apparent undervaluation, certain indicators suggest it might be a potential value trap. This complexity underscores the necessity for thorough due diligence in investment decision-making. The Piotroski F-score, a tool developed by accounting professor Joseph Piotroski, assesses the strength of a company's financial health. It evaluates nine criteria under three categories: profitability, leverage/liquidity/source of funds, and operating efficiency. Moderna's current Piotroski F-Score, however, falls at the lower end of this spectrum, indicating potential red flags for investors. A Snapshot of Moderna Inc (MRNA, Financial) Moderna is a commercial-stage biotech founded in 2010. It had its initial public offering in December 2018. The company's mRNA technology was rapidly validated with its COVID-19 vaccine, authorized in the United States in December 2020. As of mid-2023, Moderna had 39 mRNA development candidates in clinical trials. The programs span a wide range of therapeutic areas, including infectious disease, oncology, cardiovascular disease, and rare genetic diseases. Conclusion: A Potential Value Trap? While Moderna's stock appears undervalued based on its GF Value, the company's low Piotroski F-Score suggests potential financial health risks. This dichotomy highlights the importance of comprehensive analysis before making investment decisions. Despite the allure of undervaluation, Moderna (MRNA, Financial) might indeed be a value trap.

The companies on Monday said the Phase 3 randomized clinical trial will evaluate the combination as adjuvant treatment in patients with certain types of resected non-small cell lung cancer. Merck and Moderna, which previously launched a Phase 3 study of the combination in patients with resected high-risk melanoma, said they plan to continue expansion of the clinical development program for V940 to additional tumor types. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death around the world, with non-small cell lung cancer accounting for more than 80% of all cases. Keytruda is a cancer drug that harnesses a patient's immune system to fight tumors, while individualized neoantigen therapies such as V940 are designed to train and activate an antitumor immune response by generating specific T-cell responses based on the unique mutational signature of a patient's tumor.

        "title": "\"Moderna (MRNA): A Smart Investment or a Value Trap? An In-Depth Exploration\"",
        "content": "Value-focused investors continuously seek stocks priced below their intrinsic value. One such stock that warrants attention is Moderna Inc (MRNA, Financial). Currently priced at 77.53, the stock recorded an 8.84% gain in a day and a 3-month decrease of 28.34%. The GF Value of the stock is estimated at $112.71. However, despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Moderna should not be overlooked. An Overview of the GF Value The GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock, derived from our unique methodology. The GF Value Line on our summary page provides a snapshot of the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded. This calculation is based on three key factors: Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio, and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) at which the stock has traded. GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth. Future estimates of business performance. If the stock price significantly deviates from the GF Value Line, it indicates potential overvaluation or undervaluation, which could impact future returns. Deciphering Moderna's Risk Factors Despite Moderna's apparent undervaluation, certain indicators suggest it might be a potential value trap. This complexity underscores the necessity for thorough due diligence in investment decision-making. The Piotroski F-score, a tool developed by accounting professor Joseph Piotroski, assesses the strength of a company's financial health. It evaluates nine criteria under three categories: profitability, leverage/liquidity/source of funds, and operating efficiency. Moderna's current Piotroski F-Score, however, falls at the lower end of this spectrum, indicating potential red flags for investors. A Snapshot of Moderna Inc (MRNA, Financial) Moderna is a commercial-stage biotech founded in 2010. It had its initial public offering in December 2018. The company's mRNA technology was rapidly validated with its COVID-19 vaccine, authorized in the United States in December 2020. As of mid-2023, Moderna had 39 mRNA development candidates in clinical trials. The programs span a wide range of therapeutic areas, including infectious disease, oncology, cardiovascular disease, and rare genetic diseases. Conclusion: A Potential Value Trap? While Moderna's stock appears undervalued based on its GF Value, the company's low Piotroski F-Score suggests potential financial health risks. This dichotomy highlights the importance of comprehensive analysis before making investment decisions. Despite the allure of undervaluation, Moderna (MRNA, Financial) might indeed be a value trap.

        "content": "By Colin Kellaher Merck and Moderna have launched a second late-stage study of the combination of Merck's blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda with V940, an individualized neoantigen therapy they are jointly developing. The companies on Monday said the Phase 3 randomized clinical trial will evaluate the combination as adjuvant treatment in patients with certain types of resected non-small cell lung cancer. Merck and Moderna, which previously launched a Phase 3 study of the combination in patients with resected high-risk melanoma, said they plan to continue expansion of the clinical development program for V940 to additional tumor types. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death around the world, with non-small cell lung cancer accounting for more than 80% of all cases. Keytruda is a cancer drug that harnesses a patient's immune system to fight tumors, while individualized neoantigen therapies such as V940 are designed to train and activate an antitumor immune response by generating specific T-cell responses based on the unique mutational signature of a patient's tumor.

The Redmond, Washington-based company is expected to report earnings of $16.7 billion, or $2.24 cents a share, effectively unchanged from the prior-year quarter, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Revenue is expected to increase 3% year-over-year to $51.1 billion. The company will report financial results for the third quarter of its 2023 fiscal year after markets close Tuesday, April 25. Investors will focus on the Intelligent Cloud segment, which has been Microsoft's largest in each of the last eight quarters. Cloud revenue is expected to grow at its slowest rate in five years, increasing 15% to $21.9 billion. Global spending on cloud services is projected to hit a record $592 billion in 2023, a 21% increase from last year, according to research firm Gartner. Nonetheless, Microsoft's cloud business could be a bright spot as the company is projected to post a double-digit revenue decline in its Personal Computing segment, which consists of Windows products and devices like the Surface tablet and Xbox gaming console. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is expected to face questions about the future of Microsoft's AI tools and the impact of cost-cutting measures. Nadella is likely to base much of the company’s outlook on the push to AI. “The next major wave of computing is being born, as the Microsoft Cloud turns the world’s most advanced AI models into a new computing platform,” he said in last quarter's earnings releases. Microsoft extended its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI in January, investing a reported $10 billion in the start-up that has been privately valued at $29 billion. Microsoft's AI-enhanced search engine, Bing, surpassed 100 million daily active users for the first time in March. Despite the buzz, analysts are expecting search and ad revenue to grow just 4% in the last quarter, compared with 22% growth in the same period a year ago.

Yet Alphabet did say it took $2 billion in expenses in the first quarter for employee severance and related charges after slashing 12,000 jobs in January. The company added that it had incurred charges of $564 million for office space reductions and said that it may “further evaluate” office space requirements in the future.

Versioning (also known as \"quality discrimination\") is a business practice in which a company produces different models of essentially the same product and then charges different prices for each model. Versioning a product gives the consumer the option of purchasing a higher valued model for more money or a lower-valued model for less money. In this way, the business is attempting to attract higher prices based on the value a customer perceives. Versioning Explained Versioning is usually done when a product has large fixed costs of production and small variable costs. For example, in software packages, features are added or taken away to give different versions and price points, because generally speaking, having different options will accommodate different utilities of consumers. This idea is based on a customer's willingness to pay. A higher willingness to pay will result in the purchase of a higher-quality product, and a lower willingness to pay will result in the purchase of a lower-quality product. Versioning can be found in a wide variety of industries. In the consumer technology market, tablets and smartphones often are released in different versions that may feature varied tiers of data storage capacity and other options. For instance, a higher-end version of a smartphone may include a higher resolution screen for playing back video as well as control features not found on the other phones in the product line. Often, versions will include a low-cost or budget model with no frills and only basic functionality as well as a high-end or luxury model with all the bells and whistles and higher quality trim, which comes at the highest price point. Examples of Versioning Software suites frequently see versioning options that allow customers to choose the features they want to pay to access. For example, Microsoft sells its Office Suite of programs in different versions in-home, personal, and student variations. The company also offers the software suite in different tiers for business users, with each iteration including different software titles as well as services, depending on the version purchased. Subscription television providers, which can be cable or satellite, can also offer customers different versions of their services, typically offered as packages set at different prices. As more channels are added, the price increases, with premium channels often reserved for the more costly package offerings. The auto industry applies versioning to its products as well. The base model of most any vehicle can be equipped with optional features, such as premium sound systems, connectivity with internet and data services, and onboard roadside services. The vehicle may have engine options, allowing for faster models. Seating options can also increase or decrease the passenger capacity across different models.\n\n---\n\n[2023-01-31] 2023-01-31 00:00:00\n标题: Is a Career in Investment Banking Worth It?\n内容: Investment bankers are typically the highest-paid workers in the finance industry—high salaries are most prevalent even among younger employees. The starting salary for the typical investment banker exceeds that of most other finance positions, but working in this field has its challenges. Aspiring finance professionals may wish to examine whether a career in investment banking is worth it. Investment Banker Work Environment An investment banker works with companies and government entities that raise capital, and bankers also provide advice regarding mergers, acquisitions, and reorganizations. Traditionally, investment bankers work long hours, sometimes as many as 100 hours per week. Bankers are often under time pressure as many projects have tight deadlines. However, the banking culture also values and admires people who work long hours, and many firms have a culture of conspicuous work. This term refers to a corporate culture in which each employee notices the hours worked by everyone else, and this situation creates a competition to take on more work at all costs. Reliable bankers are given more work, and that leads to a work schedule that can become unmanageable. The work environment can take a physical and emotional toll on many people who work in the industry. Changes in the Industry In 2015, two young investment bankers took their own lives. Shortly before their deaths, both workers suffered from lack of sleep, and both workers reached out to family members to explain how much they were working. Those tragedies led many firms to change their company policy on work hours. Some firms now enforce a protected weekend policy, which means that bankers cannot work on specific weekends. Nearly all companies now ask workers to say no to additional work if that work will result in too many hours at the office. Ironically, recent studies have shown that overwork leaves bankers less productive, which means that more hours are not generating the same level of quality work. A common rule of thumb is that a banker should not work on more than two banking deals at one time, or the workload is not manageable. Traits of Successful Bankers Finance professionals should consider whether they have the personal traits needed to succeed in investment banking. In addition to the potential for long hours, a banker must be able to handle stress well and work on multiple deadlines at once. Investment bankers must be able to initiate projects on their own and manage time well. Financial modeling and the use of Microsoft Excel are often important skills that many investment banks must master. Alternatives to Investment Banking Investing banking firms traditionally hire new associates from the best MBA programs in the country. But, many of these students are no longer considering banking as a career. Elite MBA programs, such as the Harvard Business School, are seeing more graduates moving into tech startups and other fields, such as private equity and corporate finance. This shift has also pushed banking firms to assess the number of hours each banker works, and if those hours are justified, given client demands.

However, I’ve never been so excited about it then I am when it comes to the dramatic performance changes introduced in SQL Server 2022. THEY HAVE SOLVED ONE OF OUR BIGGEST PERFORMANCE BOTTLE NECKS, System page latch concurrency. In SQL Server 2019 they addressed what’s known as metadata contention, when pages that belong to systems object take page latches while updating tables that track table metadata by introducing memory optimized tempdb. Additionally, the product team made improvements to object allocation contention. This is the contention for metadata pages used to manage space allocation in data files known as page free space (PFS) pages. Creating or destroying temp tables and deallocating them in tables like sys.objvalues for example. Lastly, there were more improvements to temp table caching which allowed us to better reuse unaltered temp tables. All these changes delivered tempdb performance improvements, but still left us with the biggest bottleneck. Which is the way latches are created latches on system pages. In 2022 SQL Server improvements addressed just that and changes the way global allocation map (GAM) and (shared global allocation map) SGAM page latches are done. Instead of updating these through an update latch they now use a shared latch which removes nearly all of the contention as seen in the images posted by Microsoft demonstrating the effect of this change. BEFORE Upgrade Using SQL 2019 AFTER Upgrade Using SQL 2022 You can clearly see the massive impact of this. What’s even better is that these new enhancements will benefit us all especially those with heavy tempdb workload by default. If you simply upgrade to SQL Server 2022 you can immediately take advantage of these enhancements with no additional work or overhead by you. The results are amazing to say the least. David Pless, Senior Program Manager, Microsoft does a fantastic job of explaining all the new changes in this article on the Microsoft SQL Server Blog. Along with reading that I highly recommend watching this video to see a demo on how drastically this changes everything. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FYyOk27ZxM I cannot wait to see this in production as clients start to move to SQL Server 2022.\n\n---\n\n[2023-02-02] 2023-02-02 08:00:30\n标题: Liquit Continues Growth as Ben Ward Joins Company as Field CTO for UK and Ireland\n内容: Ben brings over two decades of experience as a veteran of the EUC industry working with some of the largest vendors in this space such as VMware, Citrix and IGEL.

        "title": "Versioning: What it Means, How it Works, Examples",
        "content": "What Is Versioning? Versioning (also known as \"quality discrimination\") is a business practice in which a company produces different models of essentially the same product and then charges different prices for each model. Versioning a product gives the consumer the option of purchasing a higher valued model for more money or a lower-valued model for less money. In this way, the business is attempting to attract higher prices based on the value a customer perceives. Versioning Explained Versioning is usually done when a product has large fixed costs of production and small variable costs. For example, in software packages, features are added or taken away to give different versions and price points, because generally speaking, having different options will accommodate different utilities of consumers. This idea is based on a customer's willingness to pay. A higher willingness to pay will result in the purchase of a higher-quality product, and a lower willingness to pay will result in the purchase of a lower-quality product. Versioning can be found in a wide variety of industries. In the consumer technology market, tablets and smartphones often are released in different versions that may feature varied tiers of data storage capacity and other options. For instance, a higher-end version of a smartphone may include a higher resolution screen for playing back video as well as control features not found on the other phones in the product line. Often, versions will include a low-cost or budget model with no frills and only basic functionality as well as a high-end or luxury model with all the bells and whistles and higher quality trim, which comes at the highest price point. Examples of Versioning Software suites frequently see versioning options that allow customers to choose the features they want to pay to access. For example, Microsoft sells its Office Suite of programs in different versions in-home, personal, and student variations. The company also offers the software suite in different tiers for business users, with each iteration including different software titles as well as services, depending on the version purchased. Subscription television providers, which can be cable or satellite, can also offer customers different versions of their services, typically offered as packages set at different prices. As more channels are added, the price increases, with premium channels often reserved for the more costly package offerings. The auto industry applies versioning to its products as well. The base model of most any vehicle can be equipped with optional features, such as premium sound systems, connectivity with internet and data services, and onboard roadside services. The vehicle may have engine options, allowing for faster models. Seating options can also increase or decrease the passenger capacity across different models."

        "title": "Is a Career in Investment Banking Worth It?",
        "content": "Investment bankers are typically the highest-paid workers in the finance industry—high salaries are most prevalent even among younger employees. The starting salary for the typical investment banker exceeds that of most other finance positions, but working in this field has its challenges. Aspiring finance professionals may wish to examine whether a career in investment banking is worth it. Investment Banker Work Environment An investment banker works with companies and government entities that raise capital, and bankers also provide advice regarding mergers, acquisitions, and reorganizations. Traditionally, investment bankers work long hours, sometimes as many as 100 hours per week. Bankers are often under time pressure as many projects have tight deadlines. However, the banking culture also values and admires people who work long hours, and many firms have a culture of conspicuous work. This term refers to a corporate culture in which each employee notices the hours worked by everyone else, and this situation creates a competition to take on more work at all costs. Reliable bankers are given more work, and that leads to a work schedule that can become unmanageable. The work environment can take a physical and emotional toll on many people who work in the industry. Changes in the Industry In 2015, two young investment bankers took their own lives. Shortly before their deaths, both workers suffered from lack of sleep, and both workers reached out to family members to explain how much they were working. Those tragedies led many firms to change their company policy on work hours. Some firms now enforce a protected weekend policy, which means that bankers cannot work on specific weekends. Nearly all companies now ask workers to say no to additional work if that work will result in too many hours at the office. Ironically, recent studies have shown that overwork leaves bankers less productive, which means that more hours are not generating the same level of quality work. A common rule of thumb is that a banker should not work on more than two banking deals at one time, or the workload is not manageable. Traits of Successful Bankers Finance professionals should consider whether they have the personal traits needed to succeed in investment banking. In addition to the potential for long hours, a banker must be able to handle stress well and work on multiple deadlines at once. Investment bankers must be able to initiate projects on their own and manage time well. Financial modeling and the use of Microsoft Excel are often important skills that many investment banks must master. Alternatives to Investment Banking Investing banking firms traditionally hire new associates from the best MBA programs in the country. But, many of these students are no longer considering banking as a career. Elite MBA programs, such as the Harvard Business School, are seeing more graduates moving into tech startups and other fields, such as private equity and corporate finance. This shift has also pushed banking firms to assess the number of hours each banker works, and if those hours are justified, given client demands. Alternative career paths to investment banking can include asset management, corporate finance, or equity research. The Bottom Line If a professional is not willing to make these sacrifices and is not primarily driven by money, that worker may not succeed as an investment banker. Finance professionals who need a balance between work and personal life should not work in investment banking."

Instead, Netflix House, as the locations will be called, will be a fan experience, letting visitors grab a bite to eat, shop for merchandise based on the streaming network’s shows, and even play games, including an obstacle course based on Squid Game. Some will also have a movie theater, showing Netflix films. Attractions will rotate to keep the experience fresh and to help promote new hit programs and films. The first two locations are expected to open in 2025, though locations have not yet been announced. CEO Ted Sarandos announced plans for Netflix House Thursday during the Bloomberg Screentime conference. “Don’t think of it like Disneyland,” Sarandos said. “[This is] something you might go to a couple times a month, not just once every couple years.” The permanent locations are a continuation of the fan experiences Netflix has had touring the country since the pandemic. A Stranger Things drive-through proved popular when people could not gather together—and several other interactive experiences tied to that show have emerged since. And a Bridgerton Ball has proven popular with fans of that show. “This is the next generation of all these traveling experiences we’ve been doing,” said Sarandos. “We’re going to pull them together and build a more permanent experience.” Netflix reportedly views the facilities less as a revenue-generating device and more as a promotional tool for its films and shows. Netflix already has existing deals to sell Stranger Things–related food items in Walmart.

We estimate that Netflix’s revenue will come in at a little over $8.50 billion for the quarter, marginally below consensus estimates and the company’s guidance. This would mark year-over-year growth of roughly 7.5%. We estimate that earnings will stand at $3.50 per share, also roughly in line with the consensus. So what are some of the trends that are likely to drive Netflix earnings for the quarter? See our interactive dashboard analysis on Netflix Earnings Preview for more details on how Netflix’s revenues and earnings are likely to trend for the quarter. We note that NFLX stock has had a Sharpe Ratio of 0.5 since early 2017, which is in line with the 0.5 ratio for the S&P 500 Index over the same period. This compares with the Sharpe of 1.2 for the Trefis Reinforced Value portfolio. Sharpe is a measure of return per unit of risk, and high-performance portfolios can provide the best of both worlds. Netflix began rolling out restrictions on password sharing in the U.S. and over 100 other countries in late May 2023, requiring users to pay an additional monthly fee (about $8 in the U.S.) to share accounts with users outside of their households. The move appears to have gotten off to a strong start, with Netflix adding 5.9 million subscribers over the second quarter, with the company noting that sign-ups exceeded cancellations – an indication that the reaction to the big move was relatively favorable. Revenue growth is expected to pick up in Q3, as the company sees the full impact of the password sharing crackdown. Separately, Netflix’s ad-supported plan could also potentially start playing a bigger role in the context of Netflix’s overall business. The company upgraded the streaming resolutions on the plan to 1080p (up from 720p) while supporting two concurrent streams. Netflix has previously indicated that the average revenue per membership for its ad-supported plan has exceeded its standard plan, accounting for both subscription fees and advertising revenues. Although we think that Netflix stock could move slightly higher if it beats earnings, we believe the stock is fully valued at current levels of about $377 per share. The streaming wars are heating up and it’s likely that mounting competition could put a lid on the company’s overall growth in the long run. Moreover, concerns about the broader macroeconomic picture could also weigh on players such as Netflix who are dependent on growing consumer spending. The company raised prices across its plans last year, bringing the standard HD plan to $15.49 per month and there have been reports that another price hike is in the cards once the Hollywood writers’ strike ends. We have a $377 price estimate for Netflix. See our analysis Netflix Valuation: Expensive or Cheap for more details on what’s driving our price estimate for Netflix.

Netflix today raised the price on its premium tier by $3 a month to $22.99, a notably bigger increase than the last time it jacked up prices. Aggressive price increases are becoming standard in streaming, at least among the bigger companies, as we noted here recently. A few days ago, for instance, Disney implemented previously-announced price increases of $3 a month on both Hulu and Disney+, taking those two to $17.99 and $13.99 a month respectively. We should add that, for both Netflix and Disney, these increases only apply to ad-free tiers. And for Netflix, only its most expensive tier, which offers the best video quality, as well as a basic tier the company no longer offers to new members. (It didn’t raise the price on its mid-range ad-free tier). Both Disney and Netflix are using pricing to push people into their low-priced tiers that carry commercials, which is where they see more potential for growth, given that it’s getting tougher to grow by signing up new subscribers. They’re not being as obnoxious about it as Amazon, which early next year will put ads on its Prime Video service and subscribers who hate ads will have to opt out by paying a few extra dollars a month. As we reported this week, Amazon hopes that strategy will ensure it has a bigger audience to sell to advertisers. We’re sure the FTC will be monitoring any “dark patterns” Amazon employs to complicate opting into the ad-free tier.",

Aggressive price increases are becoming standard in streaming, at least among the bigger companies, as we noted here recently. A few days ago, for instance, Disney implemented previously-announced price increases of $3 a month on both Hulu and Disney+, taking those two to $17.99 and $13.99 a month respectively. We should add that, for both Netflix and Disney, these increases only apply to ad-free tiers. And for Netflix, only its most expensive tier, which offers the best video quality, as well as a basic tier the company no longer offers to new members. (It didn’t raise the price on its mid-range ad-free tier). Both Disney and Netflix are using pricing to push people into their low-priced tiers that carry commercials, which is where they see more potential for growth, given that it’s getting tougher to grow by signing up new subscribers. They’re not being as obnoxious about it as Amazon, which early next year will put ads on its Prime Video service and subscribers who hate ads will have to opt out by paying a few extra dollars a month. As we reported this week, Amazon hopes that strategy will ensure it has a bigger audience to sell to advertisers. We’re sure the FTC will be monitoring any “dark patterns” Amazon employs to complicate opting into the ad-free tier."

The CRTC, Canada’s broadcasting regulator, will be in charge of implementing the new law, which covers streaming platforms. Its myth-busting document addresses criticisms of the new rules, including that they will lead to the regulation of digital creators. Scott Benzie, executive director of Digital First, an organization that represents people who post videos on streaming platforms, including YouTube and TikTok, said the CRTC’s document reads like a product of the federal Heritage Department, and not an independent regulatory body. “The myth and fact sheet might as well have been written by the minister,” Mr. Benzie said, referring to Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez. “It’s downright weird.” Mr. Rodriguez is planning to send a ministerial direction to the CRTC within weeks, setting out his priorities for the implementation of the bill. Mr. Benzie said he is unsure why the CRTC has published details about what it will regulate before receiving that direction and carrying out consultations. “They are supposed to wait for the policy direction. They haven’t done that, which makes me feel that decisions have been made. They haven’t heard any evidence, and they have already made up their mind,” he said. The legislation, known as Bill C-11, became law on April 27, after extensive debate and close scrutiny in both the Commons and Senate. Mr. Rodriguez has said that user-generated content will not be covered by the new online streaming act. He and other Liberal MPs have rebutted accusations from Conservatives – including Tory Leader Pierre Poilievre – that the law could lead to the CRTC censoring what people watch. The CRTC document, entitled “Myths and Facts about Bill C-11,″ says it is a myth that the CRTC will regulate digital creators. It says it is a fact that the regulator will only regulate broadcasters, and not YouTubers, influencers or people making content on social media platforms. Another “myth” it addresses is the idea that the CRTC will regulate the algorithms of online streaming services, such as YouTube. The document says “we will not regulate algorithms. We want to encourage innovation to make Canadian and Indigenous content easier to find.” The document says it is also a myth that “the CRTC will censor what you watch, read or listen to online.” “We will not censor the content Canadians listen to and watch online,” it says. Valérie Lavallée, a CRTC spokesperson, said the regulator had taken note “that a lot of information and opinions have been publicly shared about Bill C-11, the Online Streaming Act.” “Our web information is intended to address some of the concerns that have been raised,” she said. Conservative MPs, including Mr. Poilievre and Rachael Thomas, the party’s heritage critic, previously argued in Parliament that C-11 was a censorship bill. Liberal MPs said this was untrue and accused them of scaremongering. Ms. Thomas also raised concerns in the Commons that Bill C-11 could lead to the manipulation of YouTube’s algorithms, for the purpose of promoting Canadian content. In addition, she argued that the legislation would lead to the regulation of videos made by digital creators. She said in an interview that the CRTC has a responsibility to remain neutral. “The CRTC, which is supposed to be an independent arm’s-length body, for purely regulatory purposes, is touting the exact same talking points that the Minister of Heritage and the Prime Minister are touting,” Ms. Thomas said. “That’s concerning for me.“ The CRTC will hold extensive consultations this year and next on its plans to build a regulatory framework for broadcasters and streaming platforms based on the new law. Alongside the myth-busting document, the CRTC published a timetable. The regulator says it plans to implement the new framework late next year. The Canadian Association of Broadcasters is among the bodies watching the implementation of the bill closely. “This is when the rubber really hits the road,” said Kevin Desjardins, the association’s president. He added that he wants to ensure Canadian broadcasters don’t bear a heavier regulatory burden than online streaming platforms such as Netflix.\n\n---\n\n[2023-05-12] 2023-05-12 04:11:19\n标题: Netflix is investing $2.5 billion to make Korean shows, says VP of Korean content\n内容: Don Kang, Netflix vice president of Korean content, says \"our primary focus is the local audience in Korea.\"\n\n---\n\n[2023-05-15] 2023-05-15 00:00:00\n标题: Journal 7 (docx) - Course Sidekick\n内容: 1 Journal 7 Campbellsville University. BA60280G322 Kiran Palla Some of the few things I learned from this week were overall process that a business goes through in developing a new software application. They are: 2 1. Identify the Problem: Determine the purpose of the software and what needs it is attempting to solve. 2. Research and Analyze: Research the existing software solutions and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. 3. Design and Plan: Design the software architecture and plan out the development process. 4. Develop and Test: Develop the software and test it to ensure it meets the requirements. 5. Deploy and Maintain: Deploy the software and maintain it to ensure it is up to date and functioning properly. Software Development Methodologies are different approaches to software development. The main difference between them is the way they organize and manage the development process. Some of the popular methodologies include Agile, Waterfall, DevOps, and Lean. Some of the insights on Netflix is first to understand how the Netflix business model was, So after some research, here are the findings: 1. Netflix leverages a subscription-based business model. Subscribers pay a monthly fee to access the streaming service's library of movies and TV shows. 2. Netflix generates revenue through a combination of subscriptions, advertising, and other services such as the DVD-by-mail service. 3. The company acquires content by licensing it from studios and other content providers. 4. Netflix distributes its content through its streaming service, and also through partnerships with other streaming services, cable companies, and other distributors. 5. Netflix invests heavily in research and development to continually improve its streaming technology and user experience. 3 6. Netflix uses data analytics to target viewers with personalized recommendations and develop new content. 7. The company is also investing in original content development, which has been a major driver of growth. One downside Netflix firm have experienced from an early IPO is that it may have led to other competitors jump in quickly after recognizing the growth opportunity in the subscription based time to build a track record for the company and its products. This could lead to difficulty in attracting investors and maintaining a high share price. As a professional , It is important to be aware of the ethical dilemma of using information technology so that I can make sure I am making responsible decisions when it comes to collecting, storing, and using data. This means understanding the potential risks associated with data security, privacy, and ethical use of technology. Additionally, I need to ensure that I am not collecting personal data unless I have the legal right to do so, and I am taking measures to protect the data from potential misuse. Furthermore, I need to be aware of the potential for conflict of interest when using technology and ensure that I am making decisions that are in alignment with the mission and values of the organization. One of the topics I would like to learn more about is the issues that's holding back streaming video companies like Netflix and Amazon. Issues persisting like Limited Bandwidth, Cost, Compatibility, Security, Quality, and Technology.\n\n---\n\n[2023-05-16] 2023-05-16 00:00:00\n标题: What to read about villains in business\n内容: THE TELLING OF a juicy corporate scandal is like a detective story. The investigator, usually a journalist, must examine the clues, interrogate those suspects who are willing to talk and, with luck, determine a solution: “It was the finance director in the annual accounts with the fake revenues!” This collection of four books and a television documentary covers a wide range of industries and countries, from Silicon Valley to 18th-century India. The common factor in four of these cases is the enormous difficulties faced by those who try to investigate. It is not just that outsiders will always struggle to find detailed information on the inner workings of a business. Companies have lots of weapons to fight back, from legal action to silence whistleblowers to enlisting the help of friendly regulators. The struggles involved in bringing these stories to light suggest that many more corporate scandals have yet to be uncovered. The incentives for corporate malfeasance are as great today as they were when humble clerks could become wealthy “nabobs” by working for the East India Company. Create the right business model (or the appearance of one) and you can join the global elite. But the more successful the fraud, the harder it becomes to maintain as the company grows; ever greater trickery is needed to create the illusion of continued progress. All too often, it is the executives’ hubris, as much as the investigators’ tenacity, that brings them down in the end. Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Start-Up. By John Carreyrou. Picador; 352 pages, $30. Picador; £9.99 Bill Gates described this book as a “thriller” and it is easy to understand why. It is the extraordinary story of Theranos, a health-care company led by the charismatic Elizabeth Holmes (pictured), which claimed to have a product that could diagnose all sorts of diseases with a tiny blood sample. The company managed to attract luminaries such as Henry Kissinger and General James Mattis to its board and lured Rupert Murdoch as an investor. But its technology never actually worked and its elaborate security was designed not to protect its secrets but to disguise its lack of progress. Whistleblowers were fired, or silenced with non-disclosure agreements, and doctors were intimidated, making it hard for the author, a reporter for the Wall Street Journal, to uncover the story. We reviewed the book in 2018. The saga is also compellingly recounted in “The Dropout”, a docu-drama (first shown on Hulu, then on Disney+) based on a separate podcast. It stars Amanda Seyfried as Ms Holmes and features a wonderful cameo from Laurie Metcalf as a sceptical academic. Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty. By Patrick Radden Keefe. Doubleday; 560 pages; $18. Picador; £20 The Theranos scandal is relatively small compared with the opioid crisis that has affected America in recent decades. In his meticulously researched book, Patrick Radden Keefe, a reporter for the New Yorker, recounts the history of the Sacklers, the family behind Oxycontin, the drug that many blame for the crisis. It is hard for the reader not to become angry as this tale unfolds. Regulators fail for years to prevent the marketing of an addictive drug, and members of the Sackler family escape serious personal consequences. Our full review of the book was published in 2021. The Oxycontin story is also the subject of a TV series, “Dopesick” (based on a different book), with Michael Keaton as a small-town doctor who eventually becomes horrified at the drug’s toll on his patients. The Smartest Guys in the Room: The Amazing Rise and Scandalous Fall of Enron. By Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind. Portfolio; 480 pages; $15. Penguin; £11.95 Both the Theranos and the Sackler scandals concern the products that the companies offered; the collapse of Enron is more to do with accounting. The energy company owned and operated gas pipelines and electricity plants, and traded derivative contracts. But its opaque accounting practices in effect enabled the group to inflate its revenues and hide its debts, while investors believed that the deregulation of the energy market gave the company the potential for endless growth. When it all collapsed, Enron took down its auditor, Arthur Andersen, and prompted Congress to pass the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to reform corporate governance. This book is an excellent example of business reporting. For a dramatic version, there is nothing better than “Enron”, a play by Lucy Prebble, which brilliantly imagines the hidden debts of the company as dinosaurs in the basement that need constant feeding. Skandal! Bringing Down Wirecard. Directed by James Erskine. Netflix The collapse of Wirecard, a German payments processor, is another case of accounting shenanigans. A book by Dan McCrum, a journalist for the Financial Times whose reporting helped to uncover the fraud, was featured in our round-up of the best business tomes. Mr McCrum also tells the tale in this lively Netflix documentary. What makes it stand out is that the FT did not just have to face counter-measures by the company (which included hiring private detectives) but also the wrath of the German corporate establishment, which saw the stories as an attack on a national champion. It is nice for once to see short-sellers appear in a heroic light rather than as bloodsucking villains, which is how the media normally portray them. The Anarchy: The Relentless Rise of the East India Company. By William Dalrymple. Bloomsbury; 576 pages; $12.95. Bloomsbury; £12.99 Modern accounts of corporate scandals tend to focus on the harm done to shareholders and customers. But perhaps the most astonishing example of corporate power was the way that a British company managed to take over much of the Indian subcontinent. When the company’s emissaries first visited the Mughal empire in the early 17th century they were awed by its wealth. By the mid 18th century, they could take that wealth for themselves; the word “loot”, from Hindi, referred to the fortunes amassed by company officials. The English used their superior military technology, and a strategy of “divide and rule”, to overwhelm the Mughals, who had already been weakened by attacks from inside and outside their empire. In the process, the Indian people were exploited and impoverished. We reviewed the book in 2019. Also try In 2022 we set out why times of high interest rates can reveal corporate fraud. Our explainer from May 2023 looks at why America’s financial regulator has paid out more than $1bn to whistleblowers since 2010. And we’ve rounded up five of the best books about financial crime.\n\n---\n\n[2023-05-17] 2023-05-17 00:21:59\n标题: Girl allegedly abducted by mother without custody found safe in North Carolina\n内容: ST. CHARLES, Ill. (AP) — A girl who was allegedly abducted by her mother in suburban Chicago nearly six years ago has been found safe hundreds of miles away in North Carolina after she was spotted at a business, authorities said. Officers found a woman and a minor child at the business in Asheville, North Carolina, and were able to confirm their identities, police said. They said the woman, Heather Unbehaun, 40, was wanted on an extradition warrant out of Illinois for child abduction. Unbehaun didn’t have custody of the girl after a court order granted permanent custody to the child’s father, the Kane County State’s Attorney’s Office said. Unbehaun posted $25,000 bond Tuesday and was released from custody, the state’s attorney’s office said. Unbehaun declined to waive extradition, it said. It wasn’t clear whether she had an attorney who could comment on the allegations against her. South Elgin, Illinois, police said they were notified Saturday by police in Asheville that they had received a tip from a store employee who recognized Unbehaun and recalled that the child was missing. A store employee immediately notified Asheville police, who contacted South Elgin police. Asheville police then took Unbehaun into custody. The child has since been reunited with her father in South Elgin, which is nearly 700 miles (1,126 kilometers) away. “We are overjoyed to report that the child is in good condition and in good spirits since being reunited with her father,” South Elgin Police Chief Jerry Krawczyk said in a statement. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said the girl was 9 when Unehaun allegedly abducted her from South Elgin on July 5, 2017. In its news release, the center included a statement from the girl’s father, identified only as “Ryan,” where he said he’s “overjoyed” that his daughter “is home safe.” He thanked the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, South Elgin police and other law enforcement agencies for their efforts. “We ask for privacy as we get to know each other again and navigate this new beginning,” he added. The girl’s 2017 abduction was featured on the Netflix Unsolved Mysteries reboot, WLOS-TV reported.\n\n---\n\n[2023-05-18] 2023-05-18 02:40:52\n标题: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle NYC paparazzi drama only an attempt to grab spotlight\n内容: It was strange that nobody in NYC noticed the supposed two-hour \"near catastrophic\" high-speed car chase of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. MEGA It was strange that nobody in NYC noticed the supposed two-hour “near catastrophic” high-speed car chase of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle by “a ring of highly aggressive paparazzi.” In a city gridlocked with traffic, even Mayor Eric Adams said he found the claim by the royal grifters “hard to believe”. The NYPD rained on their parade, too: “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex arrived at their destination and there were no reported collisions, summonses, injuries, or arrests in regard.” The taxi driver who ferried the couple home after their event Tuesday at the Ziegfeld Theater told The Washington Post that he would not call it a “chase, adding that he felt safe during the ride.” The Harkles are suffering relevance deprivation syndrome and a bad case of jealousy after Princess Kate and Prince William shone at the Coronation. This drama is an attempt to grab the spotlight after nobody in New York noticed they were here. Coincidentally, as Page Six reported, the incident occurred “hours after Harry was told that UK police are not for hire” in his legal battle demanding taxpayer funded security. A timeline of the alleged car chase issued by the NYPD, says Harry and Meghan didn’t want paparazzi to know where they were staying. So they were driven around Manhattan aimlessly for one hour and 15 minutes to create drama rather than driving a few minutes to their accommodation on the Upper East Side.

A book by Dan McCrum, a journalist for the Financial Times whose reporting helped to uncover the fraud, was featured in our round-up of the best business tomes. Mr McCrum also tells the tale in this lively Netflix documentary. What makes it stand out is that the FT did not just have to face counter-measures by the company (which included hiring private detectives) but also the wrath of the German corporate establishment, which saw the stories as an attack on a national champion. It is nice for once to see short-sellers appear in a heroic light rather than as bloodsucking villains, which is how the media normally portray them. The Anarchy: The Relentless Rise of the East India Company. By William Dalrymple. Bloomsbury; 576 pages; $12.95. Bloomsbury; £12.99 Modern accounts of corporate scandals tend to focus on the harm done to shareholders and customers. But perhaps the most astonishing example of corporate power was the way that a British company managed to take over much of the Indian subcontinent. When the company’s emissaries first visited the Mughal empire in the early 17th century they were awed by its wealth. By the mid 18th century, they could take that wealth for themselves; the word “loot”, from Hindi, referred to the fortunes amassed by company officials. The English used their superior military technology, and a strategy of “divide and rule”, to overwhelm the Mughals, who had already been weakened by attacks from inside and outside their empire. In the process, the Indian people were exploited and impoverished. We reviewed the book in 2019. Also try In 2022 we set out why times of high interest rates can reveal corporate fraud. Our explainer from May 2023 looks at why America’s financial regulator has paid out more than $1bn to whistleblowers since 2010. And we’ve rounded up five of the best books about financial crime."

        "content": "ST. CHARLES, Ill. (AP) — A girl who was allegedly abducted by her mother in suburban Chicago nearly six years ago has been found safe hundreds of miles away in North Carolina after she was spotted at a business, authorities said. Officers found a woman and a minor child at the business in Asheville, North Carolina, and were able to confirm their identities, police said. They said the woman, Heather Unbehaun, 40, was wanted on an extradition warrant out of Illinois for child abduction. Unbehaun didn’t have custody of the girl after a court order granted permanent custody to the child’s father, the Kane County State’s Attorney’s Office said. Unbehaun posted $25,000 bond Tuesday and was released from custody, the state’s attorney’s office said. Unbehaun declined to waive extradition, it said. It wasn’t clear whether she had an attorney who could comment on the allegations against her. South Elgin, Illinois, police said they were notified Saturday by police in Asheville that they had received a tip from a store employee who recognized Unbehaun and recalled that the child was missing. A store employee immediately notified Asheville police, who contacted South Elgin police. Asheville police then took Unbehaun into custody. The child has since been reunited with her father in South Elgin, which is nearly 700 miles (1,126 kilometers) away. “We are overjoyed to report that the child is in good condition and in good spirits since being reunited with her father,” South Elgin Police Chief Jerry Krawczyk said in a statement. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said the girl was 9 when Unehaun allegedly abducted her from South Elgin on July 5, 2017. In its news release, the center included a statement from the girl’s father, identified only as “Ryan,” where he said he’s “overjoyed” that his daughter “is home safe.” He thanked the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, South Elgin police and other law enforcement agencies for their efforts. “We ask for privacy as we get to know each other again and navigate this new beginning,” he added. The girl’s 2017 abduction was featured on the Netflix Unsolved Mysteries reboot, WLOS-TV reported."

        "content": "It was strange that nobody in NYC noticed the supposed two-hour \"near catastrophic\" high-speed car chase of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. MEGA It was strange that nobody in NYC noticed the supposed two-hour “near catastrophic” high-speed car chase of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle by “a ring of highly aggressive paparazzi.” In a city gridlocked with traffic, even Mayor Eric Adams said he found the claim by the royal grifters “hard to believe”. The NYPD rained on their parade, too: “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex arrived at their destination and there were no reported collisions, summonses, injuries, or arrests in regard.” The taxi driver who ferried the couple home after their event Tuesday at the Ziegfeld Theater told The Washington Post that he would not call it a “chase, adding that he felt safe during the ride.” The Harkles are suffering relevance deprivation syndrome and a bad case of jealousy after Princess Kate and Prince William shone at the Coronation. This drama is an attempt to grab the spotlight after nobody in New York noticed they were here. Coincidentally, as Page Six reported, the incident occurred “hours after Harry was told that UK police are not for hire” in his legal battle demanding taxpayer funded security. A timeline of the alleged car chase issued by the NYPD, says Harry and Meghan didn’t want paparazzi to know where they were staying. So they were driven around Manhattan aimlessly for one hour and 15 minutes to create drama rather than driving a few minutes to their accommodation on the Upper East Side.

Analyst Matthew Harrigan, who has a sell rating and $250 per-share price target on the stock, noted the company's moves in advertising and cutting down on password sharing are likely to be \"accretive\" to revenue over time, but only offset some of the pressures for subscription revenue. Nonetheless, Harrigan added the company's advertising-supported subscription is likely to become a \"significant\" part of its overall subscriber count. \"We still estimate [advertising-video-on-demand] could provide $15 to $38 in share value depending on time frame, subject to execution,\" Harrigan wrote in an investor note. Netflix (NFLX) ended 2022 with 230.75M paid subscribers. With regards to gaming, Netflix (NFLX) said on Monday that it plans to release 100 new games (with 70 in development), including monthly releases, an update that Harrigan said is only likely to lead to \"modest retention benefits.\" Netflix (NFLX) shares were fractionally higher in premarket trading on Tuesday. Earlier this week, J.P. Morgan urged investors to buy the pullback in Netflix (NFLX) shares as the company begins its wider rollout of paid sharing.\n\n---\n\n[2023-03-22] 2023-03-22 09:10:00\n标题: A Bull Market Is Coming: 2 Reasons to Buy Disney Stock Before It's Too Late\n内容: The 2022 bear market has been brutal, with the S&P 500 still down 12% over the last 12 months. Walt Disney (DIS 1.30%) is underperforming the index, with its share price down a whopping 33% over the same time frame. But while the company hasn't adapted well to the post-pandemic economy, its long-term outlook looks bright. Let's dig deeper. What went wrong for Disney? The height of the COVID-19 pandemic was a complicated time for Disney because of its many different revenue streams. While in-person entertainment options like amusement parks and cruises saw revenue plummet amid the lockdowns and movement restrictions, its new streaming platform Disney+ soared to become a market leader. Investors initially seemed satisfied with the trade-off, but it didn't last. With a 44% decline, 2022 was one of Disney stock's worst years on record. And while some of this downside had to do with the Federal Reserve's rate hikes (which can hurt equity valuations), Disney's company-specific challenges are also mounting. In the fiscal first quarter, revenue grew by 8% year over year to $23.5 billion. But operating income fell by 7% to $3.04 billion as the parks and experience division struggled to defray losses in streaming. That said, Disney's massive investments into streaming may pay off over the long term -- especially as new management focuses on cutting costs. Streaming could become a profit driver Disney has replaced its former CEO, Bob Chapek, with his predecessor Bob Iger, who aims to focus on profitability, especially in streaming. To pull this off, the company is implementing layoffs and cost-cutting, which will involve eliminating 7,000 jobs and hopefully generate $5.5 billion in cost savings -- $3 billion of which will come from the content budget. This is fantastic news for investors. According to Statista, Disney spent a whopping $33 billion on content in 2022, far surpassing its closest rival Netflix, which spent just under $16 billion. While big-budget shows based on Star Wars and the Marvel Cinematic Universe were key to Disney's rapid streaming growth, now the company can rest on its laurels (to an extent) and begin to reap the benefits of its now immense direct-to-consumer empire. Image source: Getty Images. As of the fiscal first quarter, Disney's direct-to-consumer platforms (Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+) boast a whopping 234.7 million subscribers, compared to Netflix's 230.75 million. To put this into perspective, Netflix generated an operating profit of $5.63 billion in 2022. And while Disney might not be able to fully replicate this number, it gives an idea of how value accretive the streaming business could become if management can improve its margins. Disney expects its direct-to-consumer efforts to become profitable by 2024. The valuation is still reasonable With a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 23, Disney trades at a small premium to the S&P 500 average of 21. But while it faces a lot of challenges ranging from slowing subscriber growth to cash burn, it seems unjustifiable that shares are worth less now than before Disney+ even launched. The streaming business looks capable of overcoming its challenges and becoming a cash cow over the long term, and the current share price weakness is a buying opportunity.\n\n---\n\n[2023-03-23] 2023-03-23 00:00:00\n标题: What to watch on Thursday: ‘The Night Agent’ premieres on Netflix\n内容: (All times Eastern.)

        "content": "Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images News Investment firm Benchmark reiterated its cautious stance on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) on Tuesday as the streaming media giant's initiatives in advertising, password sharing and gaming are still a work in progress. Analyst Matthew Harrigan, who has a sell rating and $250 per-share price target on the stock, noted the company's moves in advertising and cutting down on password sharing are likely to be \"accretive\" to revenue over time, but only offset some of the pressures for subscription revenue. Nonetheless, Harrigan added the company's advertising-supported subscription is likely to become a \"significant\" part of its overall subscriber count. \"We still estimate [advertising-video-on-demand] could provide $15 to $38 in share value depending on time frame, subject to execution,\" Harrigan wrote in an investor note. Netflix (NFLX) ended 2022 with 230.75M paid subscribers. With regards to gaming, Netflix (NFLX) said on Monday that it plans to release 100 new games (with 70 in development), including monthly releases, an update that Harrigan said is only likely to lead to \"modest retention benefits.\" Netflix (NFLX) shares were fractionally higher in premarket trading on Tuesday. Earlier this week, J.P. Morgan urged investors to buy the pullback in Netflix (NFLX) shares as the company begins its wider rollout of paid sharing."

        "title": "A Bull Market Is Coming: 2 Reasons to Buy Disney Stock Before It's Too Late",
        "content": "The 2022 bear market has been brutal, with the S&P 500 still down 12% over the last 12 months. Walt Disney (DIS 1.30%) is underperforming the index, with its share price down a whopping 33% over the same time frame. But while the company hasn't adapted well to the post-pandemic economy, its long-term outlook looks bright. Let's dig deeper. What went wrong for Disney? The height of the COVID-19 pandemic was a complicated time for Disney because of its many different revenue streams. While in-person entertainment options like amusement parks and cruises saw revenue plummet amid the lockdowns and movement restrictions, its new streaming platform Disney+ soared to become a market leader. Investors initially seemed satisfied with the trade-off, but it didn't last. With a 44% decline, 2022 was one of Disney stock's worst years on record. And while some of this downside had to do with the Federal Reserve's rate hikes (which can hurt equity valuations), Disney's company-specific challenges are also mounting. In the fiscal first quarter, revenue grew by 8% year over year to $23.5 billion. But operating income fell by 7% to $3.04 billion as the parks and experience division struggled to defray losses in streaming. That said, Disney's massive investments into streaming may pay off over the long term -- especially as new management focuses on cutting costs. Streaming could become a profit driver Disney has replaced its former CEO, Bob Chapek, with his predecessor Bob Iger, who aims to focus on profitability, especially in streaming. To pull this off, the company is implementing layoffs and cost-cutting, which will involve eliminating 7,000 jobs and hopefully generate $5.5 billion in cost savings -- $3 billion of which will come from the content budget. This is fantastic news for investors. According to Statista, Disney spent a whopping $33 billion on content in 2022, far surpassing its closest rival Netflix, which spent just under $16 billion. While big-budget shows based on Star Wars and the Marvel Cinematic Universe were key to Disney's rapid streaming growth, now the company can rest on its laurels (to an extent) and begin to reap the benefits of its now immense direct-to-consumer empire. Image source: Getty Images. As of the fiscal first quarter, Disney's direct-to-consumer platforms (Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+) boast a whopping 234.7 million subscribers, compared to Netflix's 230.75 million. To put this into perspective, Netflix generated an operating profit of $5.63 billion in 2022. And while Disney might not be able to fully replicate this number, it gives an idea of how value accretive the streaming business could become if management can improve its margins. Disney expects its direct-to-consumer efforts to become profitable by 2024. The valuation is still reasonable With a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 23, Disney trades at a small premium to the S&P 500 average of 21. But while it faces a lot of challenges ranging from slowing subscriber growth to cash burn, it seems unjustifiable that shares are worth less now than before Disney+ even launched. The streaming business looks capable of overcoming its challenges and becoming a cash cow over the long term, and the current share price weakness is a buying opportunity."

A GPU—a graphics processor unit. Jon Peddie has just written a three-volume series of books published by Springer that traces the history, the ecosystem and environment, and new developments of the GPU. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230216005383/en/ Jon Peddie has just written a three-volume series of books published by Springer that traces the history, the ecosystem and environment, and new developments of the GPU. These are the first and only books to cover the history leading up to the GPU, from the origins of concepts in the 1950s to the supercomputers and smartphones it powers today. (Graphic: Business Wire) These are the first and only books to cover the entire history leading up to the GPU, from the origins of concepts in the 1950s to the supercomputers and smartphones it powers today. The books show how companies started, failed, merged, and were acquired. How IP shifted worldwide and through thousands of hands, and who many of the leading developers and managers were that did it. Eighty-four companies from 3dfx to Zhixin and everyone you've heard of in between are discussed, as well as many of the people who started and ran those companies. The GPU has gone from an esoteric semiconductor of interest to gamers and CAD designers to a part of everyone's daily life. It powers our smartphones, automobiles, virtual and augmented reality, video games, and AI training. Where did these ubiquitous and amazing devices come from, and when? The concepts started in the 1950s. Then, in the 1970s, large-scale integration (VLSI) was developed, creating the microprocessor and new peripheral support devices, and chips, to drive displays. GPUs have two major components: the geometry processor and the rasterizer. The geometry processor goes back to floating point processors developed in 1981. The rasterizer is where the pixels get created, polished, and used to create the beautiful images seen on screens. Companies built graphics boards with geometry processor chips and rasterizer chips until 1999 when Nvidia merged the two into a VLSI device and called it a GPU. It was a race Nvidia barely won; a half dozen other firms were after the same prize. The race has continued at breakneck speed. The GPU has grown in power, performance, size, and price, and powers most of the computational workloads in servers in the cloud. Yet, at the same time, the GPU has shrunk to fit into smartwatches and smartphones. Follow the journey from the cold war to fantastic cinematic experiences, from driverless cars to spaceships, and from robots to smart home devices and appliances. Learn how and why games can be played on a smartphone, game console, arcade machine, or PC—no math or programming examples are included or required. Instead, these books tell a story about the technology and the people who brought the GPU from inception to today's marketplace. Dr. Jon Peddie has been active in the graphics and multimedia fields for more than 30 years. He is the president of Jon Peddie Research, which works with the top technology companies in the world to determine the next steps in product development. As an author of several nonfiction technical books, Peddie is widely hailed as an industry expert and has spoken at industry events around the world about the impact of various technologies to the industry and the general public. The three books are available for purchase on Amazon: Book One: The History of the GPU – Steps to Invention Book Two: The History of the GPU – Eras and Environment Book Three: The History of the GPU – New Developments View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230216005383/en/\n\n---\n\n[2023-02-17] 2023-02-17 03:59:31\n标题: NVDA vs. AMBA: Which AI-Related Stock is Better?\n内容: In this piece, I evaluated two artificial intelligence (AI) related stocks, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA), to determine which is better. Upon closer analysis, it looks like NVDA is the better pick, but caution is advised due to its recent run-up and upcoming earnings report. Artificial intelligence has long been a hot topic, but even more so since OpenAI released its ChatGPT AI model. Although valuation is more important now than it was a couple years ago, investors are so excited about AI that they’re pushing shares of AI-relevant companies skyward — with no consideration for fundamentals or valuation. NVDA and AMBA are both semiconductor companies. The three-year average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for the semiconductor industry is around 26 times, while the three-year average price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is around 5.5 times. However, these averages are of little use when the market is in euphoria mode. Without further ado, let’s take a look at NVDA and AMBA. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Nvidia is one of those stocks that just keep on giving. On the one hand, its multiples are through the roof, but on the other, there could be more gas left in the tank — eventually. The company’s multiples remain below where they’ve traded during past peaks, but next week’s earnings report could send its shares lower if the company disappoints, suggesting a neutral view might be appropriate. Investors have a voracious appetite for Nvidia stock whenever some new technology is linked to the company. In recent years, the shares have gone on wild rides around the explosions of interest in cryptocurrency mining, electric vehicles, and now artificial intelligence. Since going public in 1999, Nvidia has returned well over 27,000%, and since the beginning of 2023, it has gained nearly 60%. However, Nvidia shares remain significantly below their late-2021 peak of over $330. The chipmaker’s trailing P/E stands at around 97.7 times, while its P/S is around 19 times. Nvidia’s P/E peaked at around 110 in late 2021, while its P/S was around 35 times, suggesting there might be more upside left. The chipmaker’s sales have risen steadily in recent years, granting it growth-stock status as sales rose from $10.9 billion in 2020 to $28.6 billion for the last 12 months. Nvidia also generates plenty of free cash flow, at $8.1 billion for the fiscal year that ended in January 2022. Over the last 12 months, the chipmaker reported $4.8 billion in free cash flow after repurchasing $10.6 billion in shares. Its balance sheet is also solid. With analysts like Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities proclaiming that Nvidia could win big in the “AI arms race,” there’s plenty to like and perhaps even more upside, but after its latest run, Nvidia is ultra-risky. What is the Price Target for NVDA Stock? Nvidia has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 19 Buys, five Holds, and one Sell rating assigned over the last three months. At $212.04, the average Nvidia stock price target implies downside potential of 3.6%. Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) Ambarella shares many of the same stock-price drivers, but a deeper look at its fundamentals reveals that the company isn’t nearly as strong. Essentially, the risk of Ambarella stock running out of gas is just as high as Nvidia’s, but its comparably weak fundamentals suggest a bearish view might be appropriate. The first thing a deep dive into Ambarella reveals is its lack of profitability. While the company has a solid track record of revenue and earnings beats, it just can’t seem to turn a profit, although it does generate a small amount of free cash flow. Although investors have happily granted Ambarella growth-stock status with soaring multiples despite its lack of profits, the chipmaker doesn’t deserve it. The company hasn’t been growing its revenue fast enough to be granted growth status. Ambarella’s P/S stands at around 10.6 times, remaining far below its late-2021 peak at around 26.8 times, but investors should be asking when Ambarella will become profitable. In November 2021, analysts said the chipmaker was near breakeven, so they projected profitability in 2024. In June 2022, analysts projected GAAP profitability in Fiscal 2025. While Ambarella has a healthy balance sheet with almost no debt, its valuation and lack of profitability are unbreachable barriers for now. What is the Price Target for AMBA Stock? Ambarella has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 11 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell rating assigned over the last three months. At $94.69, the average Ambarella stock price target implies upside potential of 0.73%. Conclusion: Neutral on NVDA, Bearish on AMBA Nvidia is a high-risk stock as it continued to skyrocket despite the over $50 million in insider sales over the last three months. While the stock looks good over the long term, investors might want to look for a better entry point, and one could appear following the next earnings report. Meanwhile, Ambarella is not a growth stock, although it’s valued like one. Aside from its balance sheet, there’s not much to like in the near term.

Despite the hotter inflation report that weighed on broader two weeks ago, certain tech stocks still seem worthy of consideration. Undoubtedly, the tech scene continues to be a scary place to invest. Hot inflation numbers aren’t making it easy on the Federal Reserve, which may need to maintain its hawkish tone for a while longer. The Fed does not want to undo the past year of progress as it looks to pull inflation down. As a result, the tech industry has already endured massive layoffs due to tightening credit conditions and other macro woes. Not all tech firms will adapt to these harsher conditions, but the following two highly-rated tech stocks, I believe, seem likeliest to shrug off recent woes troubling the highest-growth areas of the market. Therefore, let’s check in on two names — NVDA and UBER — that could continue trending higher from here, even as a downturn touches down. Uber (NASDAQ:UBER) Uber is a ride-hailing giant that has big plans for the next few quarters as it looks to drive toward GAAP profitability. I am bullish. The company is fresh off of a magnificent fourth quarter that saw the company clock in a surprise positive EPS figure of $0.29, well above expectations calling for a per-share loss of $0.15. Total revenue for the quarter rose to $8.6 billion, a 49% year-over-year increase. Trip requests also surged 19% year-over-year. Indeed, Uber has come such a long way since the messy days of the early pandemic when demand struggled to keep up with supply. With an industry-leading network of drivers and users, an Uber One subscription program that could get quite addictive for users who make good use of Eats and Rides, and a strong management team, it should be no mystery as to why Uber is continuing to pull ahead of peers in the space. Over time, I expect the gap to widen as Uber continues to narrow its losses en route to sustained GAAP profitability. The company’s network is just too strong to stack up against, and management’s focus on improving profitability prospects could make UBER stock tough to stop in its tracks. Up ahead, the company expects first-quarter gross bookings to rise by 20%-24% year-over-year. After an applaud-worthy quarter, I think it’s safe to say Uber is on track to hit its coming targets ahead of schedule. What is the Price Target for UBER Stock? Wall Street still loves Uber, with 24 Buys and one Hold. The average UBER stock price target of $47.71 implies 37.2% gains from current levels. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Nvidia is a GPU giant that’s been incredibly hot of late. Shares are up nearly 50% year-to-date. Though Nvidia is overdue for a pullback, it’s hard not to be enthusiastic about the name amid the recent bout of artificial intelligence (AI) hype. Nonetheless, I am neutral on the stock. Nvidia continues to be the hardware firm to bet on the future of AI technologies, and its chips don’t just stop at AI. The metaverse is another trend that could pave the way for unprecedented demand. Indeed, Nvidia may be just a semiconductor stock, but it’s one that stands behind many emerging technologies. In that regard, Nvidia may be more of a diverse play on the future of tech than you’d think. Recently, Bank of America’s (NYSE:BAC) Vivek Arya sat down with CNBC, noting that he expects Nvidia to have a lot to gain from the rise of AI. There’s no question that Nvidia has many secular tailwinds behind it. That said, its valuation remains a question mark amid continued rate hikes and medium-term macro headwinds. At 19.5 times sales and 51 times forward earnings (well above semiconductor industry averages), Nvidia is an expensive stock once again. Sure, Nvidia will play a big role in the AI race, but there’s a good chance the hype behind the name is a tad overextended. As such, I’d prefer to be a buyer of pullbacks rather than a chaser of momentum. What is the Price Target for NVDA Stock? Overall, Wall Street likes the GPU giant, with a “Moderate Buy” rating comprised of 13 Buys, two Holds, and two Sells. The average NVDA stock price target of $232.59 suggests 8.8% upside for the year ahead. The Takeaway At the end of the day, innovation could play a major role in helping firms navigate through a coming recession. With that, there are several battered tech stocks that can move on from their bear market moments en route to higher levels. Nvidia and Uber are two intriguing names to consider.

A GPU—a graphics processor unit. Jon Peddie has just written a three-volume series of books published by Springer that traces the history, the ecosystem and environment, and new developments of the GPU. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230216005383/en/ Jon Peddie has just written a three-volume series of books published by Springer that traces the history, the ecosystem and environment, and new developments of the GPU. These are the first and only books to cover the history leading up to the GPU, from the origins of concepts in the 1950s to the supercomputers and smartphones it powers today. (Graphic: Business Wire) These are the first and only books to cover the entire history leading up to the GPU, from the origins of concepts in the 1950s to the supercomputers and smartphones it powers today. The books show how companies started, failed, merged, and were acquired. How IP shifted worldwide and through thousands of hands, and who many of the leading developers and managers were that did it. Eighty-four companies from 3dfx to Zhixin and everyone you've heard of in between are discussed, as well as many of the people who started and ran those companies. The GPU has gone from an esoteric semiconductor of interest to gamers and CAD designers to a part of everyone's daily life. It powers our smartphones, automobiles, virtual and augmented reality, video games, and AI training. Where did these ubiquitous and amazing devices come from, and when? The concepts started in the 1950s. Then, in the 1970s, large-scale integration (VLSI) was developed, creating the microprocessor and new peripheral support devices, and chips, to drive displays. GPUs have two major components: the geometry processor and the rasterizer. The geometry processor goes back to floating point processors developed in 1981. The rasterizer is where the pixels get created, polished, and used to create the beautiful images seen on screens. Companies built graphics boards with geometry processor chips and rasterizer chips until 1999 when Nvidia merged the two into a VLSI device and called it a GPU. It was a race Nvidia barely won; a half dozen other firms were after the same prize. The race has continued at breakneck speed. The GPU has grown in power, performance, size, and price, and powers most of the computational workloads in servers in the cloud. Yet, at the same time, the GPU has shrunk to fit into smartwatches and smartphones. Follow the journey from the cold war to fantastic cinematic experiences, from driverless cars to spaceships, and from robots to smart home devices and appliances. Learn how and why games can be played on a smartphone, game console, arcade machine, or PC—no math or programming examples are included or required. Instead, these books tell a story about the technology and the people who brought the GPU from inception to today's marketplace. Dr. Jon Peddie has been active in the graphics and multimedia fields for more than 30 years. He is the president of Jon Peddie Research, which works with the top technology companies in the world to determine the next steps in product development. As an author of several nonfiction technical books, Peddie is widely hailed as an industry expert and has spoken at industry events around the world about the impact of various technologies to the industry and the general public.

        "title": "NVDA vs. AMBA: Which AI-Related Stock is Better?",
        "content": "In this piece, I evaluated two artificial intelligence (AI) related stocks, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA), to determine which is better. Upon closer analysis, it looks like NVDA is the better pick, but caution is advised due to its recent run-up and upcoming earnings report. Artificial intelligence has long been a hot topic, but even more so since OpenAI released its ChatGPT AI model. Although valuation is more important now than it was a couple years ago, investors are so excited about AI that they’re pushing shares of AI-relevant companies skyward — with no consideration for fundamentals or valuation. NVDA and AMBA are both semiconductor companies. The three-year average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for the semiconductor industry is around 26 times, while the three-year average price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is around 5.5 times. However, these averages are of little use when the market is in euphoria mode. Without further ado, let’s take a look at NVDA and AMBA. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Nvidia is one of those stocks that just keep on giving. On the one hand, its multiples are through the roof, but on the other, there could be more gas left in the tank — eventually. The company’s multiples remain below where they’ve traded during past peaks, but next week’s earnings report could send its shares lower if the company disappoints, suggesting a neutral view might be appropriate. Investors have a voracious appetite for Nvidia stock whenever some new technology is linked to the company. In recent years, the shares have gone on wild rides around the explosions of interest in cryptocurrency mining, electric vehicles, and now artificial intelligence. Since going public in 1999, Nvidia has returned well over 27,000%, and since the beginning of 2023, it has gained nearly 60%. However, Nvidia shares remain significantly below their late-2021 peak of over $330. The chipmaker’s trailing P/E stands at around 97.7 times, while its P/S is around 19 times. Nvidia’s P/E peaked at around 110 in late 2021, while its P/S was around 35 times, suggesting there might be more upside left.

With the surging need for potent GPUs in cryptocurrency, we thoroughly examine the GTX 770, highlighting its specs, efficiency, and work in the crypto mining landscape. NVIDIA's Kepler framework drives the GTX 770. It operates at a core clock of 1046 MHz, which can be boosted to a max of 1085 MHz, showcasing impressive agility in its prime. The GeForce GTX 770 presents 2GB (GTX 770 2GB) and 4GB (GTX 770 4GB) GDDR5 memory configurations. This memory operates on a 256-bit wide memory lane, giving a bandwidth of 224.3 GB/s. With 1536 CUDA cores, the GTX 770 was a powerhouse for graphics-heavy operations during its peak. Design and Form Factor NVIDIA showcased its design prowess with the elegant construction of the GTX 770. Encased in a dual-slot design, its metallic cover added sophistication to any mining setup. The dual-fan arrangement ensured the card remained cool, optimizing its overall functionality. Energy Consumption and Deliverables Via two 8-pin connectors, the GTX 770 draws power, having a TDP of 230W. The equilibrium between power usage and hash rate is critical for those mining crypto, making this information essential. Regarding connectivity, it provides two DVI outlets, an HDMI slot, and a DisplayPort. While gamers usually find this more beneficial, it's a point to consider for post-mining applications. Cryptocurrency Mining Potential: Can the GTX 770 Dig It? Hash Rate and Earnings The hash rate is a pivotal measure in crypto mining, signifying a GPU's speed in deciphering cryptographic challenges. The GTX 770, while not on par with recent models, provided a respectable hash rate for its era. Nevertheless, considering power expenses and the chosen cryptocurrency becomes essential.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be. Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for NVIDIA, this is the formula: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 0.12 = US$4.5b ÷ (US$44b - US$7.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023). Thus, NVIDIA has an ROCE of 12%. That's a pretty standard return and it's in line with the industry average of 12%. See our latest analysis for NVIDIA NasdaqGS:NVDA Return on Capital Employed August 18th 2023 Above you can see how the current ROCE for NVIDIA compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company. How Are Returns Trending? When we looked at the ROCE trend at NVIDIA, we didn't gain much confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 38% over the last five years. And considering revenue has dropped while employing more capital, we'd be cautious. If this were to continue, you might be looking at a company that is trying to reinvest for growth but is actually losing market share since sales haven't increased. The Key Takeaway We're a bit apprehensive about NVIDIA because despite more capital being deployed in the business, returns on that capital and sales have both fallen. The market must be rosy on the stock's future because even though the underlying trends aren't too encouraging, the stock has soared 556%. In any case, the current underlying trends don't bode well for long term performance so unless they reverse, we'd start looking elsewhere.

As defense and security officials seek to counter the threat of drones controlled by hostile foreign governments or rogue actors, DCVC-backed Fortem Technologies has emerged as the leader in AI-powered drone-hunting systems. As covered by Scientific American, the Associated Press, and other prominent news organizations, Fortem’s DroneHunters are currently deployed in Ukraine, where they have been used to bring down Iranian-made kamikaze drones and smaller reconnaissance drones used by Russia. Fortem’s interceptor drones were also on standby at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar to guard against potential threats, as reported by the BBC. Ahead of a recent trip to Ukraine, Fortem CEO Jon Gruen took time to speak with DCVC about the company’s technology, how the DroneHunter is performing in Ukraine, and what’s next for the company. In addition to leading Fortem, Gruen is a U.S. Navy Reserve SEAL Captain, has led Special Operations teams in Afghanistan and Iraq, and was the Operations Officer (J3) for all Special Operations Force activities in the Arabian Peninsula. DCVC: Drones have become integral tools for intelligence gathering and combat operations. To help the United States and its allies defend against them, Fortem designs, builds, and supplies drones that can detect and capture other drones. What is the technology that underpins Fortem’s drone-hunting systems? Gruen: Fortem’s technology is unique in that it uses high-definition small form factor radar technology, both on air interceptors and on the ground, to detect and capture other drones. The core technology, initially used to detect improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in warzones, has been refined to make it smaller and more effective for detecting and capturing drones. Our family of radars includes the R20, about the size of a pencil box, and the larger R30, about the size of a laptop. The radars, along with NVIDIA chips and edge processing, have enabled drone-on-drone defense, something that was previously nonexistent for small, fast drones. DCVC: After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Fortem supplied Kiev with its DroneHunter system, which neutralizes enemy drones by ensnaring them with nets. From the Ukrainians’ perspective, what’s the value in capturing enemy drones as opposed to destroying them? Gruen: Fortem’s DroneHunters are being used in Ukraine to defend against Russian and Iranian drones. Our use of nets is proving to be effective and valuable — the Ukrainians have captured dozens and dozens of drones in this way. The captured drones are taken to a safe location where they can be examined and analyzed to determine their origin and technical aspects. The Ukrainians have also been particularly successful in reprogramming the captured drones and using them against the Russians, which saves the Ukrainians considerable time and money that would otherwise be spent on purchasing and programming their own drones. DCVC: Besides Ukraine, where else are Fortem’s products in use — and what’s around the corner? Gruen: Our systems were deployed at both the Summer Olympics in Tokyo and at the World Cup in Qatar. They’re also being used by every major US government department and agency – at airports and military bases, among other locations – as well as in NATO countries and in Asia where there are threats from China, North Korea, Russia, and Iran. Fortem has a unique advantage in the market because we build everything from the boards on up, which allows for a highly integrated, end-to-end system. We are constantly refining and improving our products, such as rolling out a new radar this summer with increased range, improving the user interface, and using AI and machine learning to train our systems to identify the exact type of drone and anticipate its behavior. We are currently refining the F700 DroneHunter that’s deployed in Ukraine and we are developing a second drone size to take on larger drones. We are also exploring different payloads, including high-powered microwaves that can “fry” swarms of micro-drones, and even fully kinetic, explosive payloads. At the end of the day, our customers are looking for options, and so we’re constantly evolving our countermeasures to provide that flexibility.",

        "title": "Capital Allocation Trends At NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) Aren't Ideal",
        "content": "To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be. Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for NVIDIA, this is the formula: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 0.12 = US$4.5b ÷ (US$44b - US$7.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023). Thus, NVIDIA has an ROCE of 12%. That's a pretty standard return and it's in line with the industry average of 12%. See our latest analysis for NVIDIA NasdaqGS:NVDA Return on Capital Employed August 18th 2023 Above you can see how the current ROCE for NVIDIA compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company. How Are Returns Trending? When we looked at the ROCE trend at NVIDIA, we didn't gain much confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 38% over the last five years. And considering revenue has dropped while employing more capital, we'd be cautious. If this were to continue, you might be looking at a company that is trying to reinvest for growth but is actually losing market share since sales haven't increased. The Key Takeaway We're a bit apprehensive about NVIDIA because despite more capital being deployed in the business, returns on that capital and sales have both fallen. The market must be rosy on the stock's future because even though the underlying trends aren't too encouraging, the stock has soared 556%. In any case, the current underlying trends don't bode well for long term performance so unless they reverse, we'd start looking elsewhere.

        "title": "Jon Gruen: Fortem Technologies",
        "content": "Drones have become a key feature of modern warfare due to their ability to gather intelligence and carry out precision strikes with minimal risk to human operators and at relatively low cost. As defense and security officials seek to counter the threat of drones controlled by hostile foreign governments or rogue actors, DCVC-backed Fortem Technologies has emerged as the leader in AI-powered drone-hunting systems. As covered by Scientific American, the Associated Press, and other prominent news organizations, Fortem’s DroneHunters are currently deployed in Ukraine, where they have been used to bring down Iranian-made kamikaze drones and smaller reconnaissance drones used by Russia. Fortem’s interceptor drones were also on standby at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar to guard against potential threats, as reported by the BBC. Ahead of a recent trip to Ukraine, Fortem CEO Jon Gruen took time to speak with DCVC about the company’s technology, how the DroneHunter is performing in Ukraine, and what’s next for the company. In addition to leading Fortem, Gruen is a U.S. Navy Reserve SEAL Captain, has led Special Operations teams in Afghanistan and Iraq, and was the Operations Officer (J3) for all Special Operations Force activities in the Arabian Peninsula. DCVC: Drones have become integral tools for intelligence gathering and combat operations. To help the United States and its allies defend against them, Fortem designs, builds, and supplies drones that can detect and capture other drones. What is the technology that underpins Fortem’s drone-hunting systems? Gruen: Fortem’s technology is unique in that it uses high-definition small form factor radar technology, both on air interceptors and on the ground, to detect and capture other drones. The core technology, initially used to detect improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in warzones, has been refined to make it smaller and more effective for detecting and capturing drones. Our family of radars includes the R20, about the size of a pencil box, and the larger R30, about the size of a laptop. The radars, along with NVIDIA chips and edge processing, have enabled drone-on-drone defense, something that was previously nonexistent for small, fast drones. DCVC: After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Fortem supplied Kiev with its DroneHunter system, which neutralizes enemy drones by ensnaring them with nets. From the Ukrainians’ perspective, what’s the value in capturing enemy drones as opposed to destroying them? Gruen: Fortem’s DroneHunters are being used in Ukraine to defend against Russian and Iranian drones. Our use of nets is proving to be effective and valuable — the Ukrainians have captured dozens and dozens of drones in this way. The captured drones are taken to a safe location where they can be examined and analyzed to determine their origin and technical aspects. The Ukrainians have also been particularly successful in reprogramming the captured drones and using them against the Russians, which saves the Ukrainians considerable time and money that would otherwise be spent on purchasing and programming their own drones. DCVC: Besides Ukraine, where else are Fortem’s products in use — and what’s around the corner? Gruen: Our systems were deployed at both the Summer Olympics in Tokyo and at the World Cup in Qatar. They’re also being used by every major US government department and agency – at airports and military bases, among other locations – as well as in NATO countries and in Asia where there are threats from China, North Korea, Russia, and Iran. Fortem has a unique advantage in the market because we build everything from the boards on up, which allows for a highly integrated, end-to-end system. We are constantly refining and improving our products, such as rolling out a new radar this summer with increased range, improving the user interface, and using AI and machine learning to train our systems to identify the exact type of drone and anticipate its behavior. We are currently refining the F700 DroneHunter that’s deployed in Ukraine and we are developing a second drone size to take on larger drones. We are also exploring different payloads, including high-powered microwaves that can “fry” swarms of micro-drones, and even fully kinetic, explosive payloads. At the end of the day, our customers are looking for options, and so we’re constantly evolving our countermeasures to provide that flexibility."

The factory, which will produce Shein items and is part of the retailer's push to localize production, could shorten shipping time and cut distribution costs for Shein customers in Latin America. It follows its announcement that it will build a manufacturing network in Brazil to serve as a global customer base. Shein was founded in China and manufactures most of its products there, but is now seeking to diversify. The company sells $10 dresses and $5 tops and has taken market share from other affordable fashion retailers. Now headquartered in Singapore, Shein competes with PDD Holdings' PDD.O Temu, which sells low-priced items ranging from clothing to electronics from China in the U.S. A final location for the Mexico site has not been decided yet, said the sources, who requested anonymity as the discussions are private. Shein will use funds from its recent capital raise of $2 billion from investors including Mubadala MUDEV.UL and Sequoia China to fund the expansion, as it eyes an initial public offering in the U.S. Despite a valuation cut to $66 billion in its latest funding round, the retailer still posts annual revenue growth of 40%, one of the sources added. Shein, in an emailed statement, declined to comment on the plan, but said it is committed to localization as it expands to new markets. \"SHEIN’s localization strategy allows us to shorten delivery times to customers while expanding product variety and supporting local economies,\" said Marcelo Claure, chairman of SHEIN Latin America, in the statement. Shein is \"continuing to explore nearshoring options,\" he added, referring to manufacturing closer to the point of sale. Shein recently offered an online marketplace platform in Brazil, allowing third-party merchants to sell their own goods on the Shein app and website. A similar marketplace would be launched next in the U.S. before rolling out globally. The upcoming Mexico factory will not house items from third-party vendors, sources said. Claure confirmed that Shein is considering bringing its \"marketplace model to other markets across Latin America.\" Shein has come under fire in markets including India, Brazil and the U.S. for its supply-chain links to China. A bipartisan group of two dozen U.S. representatives in May called on the Securities and Exchange Commission to halt Shein’s initial public offering until the company verifies it does not use forced labor, Reuters reported. Shein has previously said it has \"zero tolerance\" for forced labor and requires suppliers to follow the International Labour Organization’s core conventions. A spokesperson referred to the same comments on Tuesday, when asked for a response on the matter. Rights groups and governments have accused China of forced labor and internment of the mainly Muslim ethnic minority in the Xinjiang region. Beijing denies any rights abuses. Shein has denied that it ships from the Xinjiang region.

        "title": "EXCLUSIVE-Fast-fashion giant Shein plans Mexico factory - sources",
        "content": "By Krystal Hu and Arriana McLymore May 23 (Reuters) - Online fashion giant Shein is exploring plans to build a factory in Mexico, as one of its manufacturing hubs outside China, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The factory, which will produce Shein items and is part of the retailer's push to localize production, could shorten shipping time and cut distribution costs for Shein customers in Latin America. It follows its announcement that it will build a manufacturing network in Brazil to serve as a global customer base. Shein was founded in China and manufactures most of its products there, but is now seeking to diversify. The company sells $10 dresses and $5 tops and has taken market share from other affordable fashion retailers. Now headquartered in Singapore, Shein competes with PDD Holdings' PDD.O Temu, which sells low-priced items ranging from clothing to electronics from China in the U.S. A final location for the Mexico site has not been decided yet, said the sources, who requested anonymity as the discussions are private. Shein will use funds from its recent capital raise of $2 billion from investors including Mubadala MUDEV.UL and Sequoia China to fund the expansion, as it eyes an initial public offering in the U.S. Despite a valuation cut to $66 billion in its latest funding round, the retailer still posts annual revenue growth of 40%, one of the sources added. Shein, in an emailed statement, declined to comment on the plan, but said it is committed to localization as it expands to new markets. \"SHEIN’s localization strategy allows us to shorten delivery times to customers while expanding product variety and supporting local economies,\" said Marcelo Claure, chairman of SHEIN Latin America, in the statement. Shein is \"continuing to explore nearshoring options,\" he added, referring to manufacturing closer to the point of sale. Shein recently offered an online marketplace platform in Brazil, allowing third-party merchants to sell their own goods on the Shein app and website. A similar marketplace would be launched next in the U.S. before rolling out globally. The upcoming Mexico factory will not house items from third-party vendors, sources said. Claure confirmed that Shein is considering bringing its \"marketplace model to other markets across Latin America.\" Shein has come under fire in markets including India, Brazil and the U.S. for its supply-chain links to China. A bipartisan group of two dozen U.S. representatives in May called on the Securities and Exchange Commission to halt Shein’s initial public offering until the company verifies it does not use forced labor, Reuters reported. Shein has previously said it has \"zero tolerance\" for forced labor and requires suppliers to follow the International Labour Organization’s core conventions. A spokesperson referred to the same comments on Tuesday, when asked for a response on the matter. Rights groups and governments have accused China of forced labor and internment of the mainly Muslim ethnic minority in the Xinjiang region. Beijing denies any rights abuses. Shein has denied that it ships from the Xinjiang region.

(PYPL), the world's largest online payment processor, likely will report an increase of more than 50% to net income for the first quarter of 2023 after trimming costs in a challenging broader economy. The payment giant probably will post net income of $779 million, up more than 53% from the same quarter a year earlier. This corresponds to adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 68 cents, up from 43 cents in the first quarter of 2022. Revenue could climb almost 8% to $7 billion, according to estimates from Visible Alpha. PayPal reports fiscal results after markets close on Monday. With inflation and interest-rate hikes weakening consumer spending in recent quarters, PayPal undertook measures to cut costs. In January, it announced that it would reduce its company headcount by 2,000, cutting roughly 7% of positions. The company is also undergoing changes to executive leadership, as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Blake Jorgensen stepped down in March and President and CEO Dan Schulman will retire at the end of the year. PayPal shares are down about 20% in the last year, while the benchmark S&P 500 Financials Sector Index has fallen 8%. Source: TradingView.

TPV is a key measure of the overall strength of PayPal's business as it reflects customer spending across PayPal's core platform as well as partner payment services. Analysts predict PayPal's TPV will climb by about 7% to $345 billion, the second-highest quarterly figure on record for the company.

Here's what investors need to know before the announcement. Analysts estimate that PayPal Holdings will report an earnings per share (EPS) of $1.10. PayPal Holdings bulls will hope to hear the company announce they've not only beaten that estimate, but also to provide positive guidance, or forecasted growth, for the next quarter. New investors should note that it is sometimes not an earnings beat or miss that most affects the price of a stock, but the guidance (or forecast). Historical Earnings Performance Last quarter the company beat EPS by $0.04, which was followed by a 3.03% increase in the share price the next day. Here's a look at PayPal Holdings's past performance and the resulting price change: Quarter Q4 2022 Q3 2022 Q2 2022 Q1 2022 EPS Estimate 1.20 0.96 0.86 0.88 EPS Actual 1.24 1.08 0.93 0.88 Price Change % 3.03% -1.79% 9.25% 11.48% Stock Performance Shares of PayPal Holdings were trading at $71.81 as of May 04.

Breyer of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted a motion to dismiss a proposed securities class action suit against a financial technology company (the “Company”) and four executives, including its CEO and CFO, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5(b). Huei-Ting Kang v. PayPal Holdings Inc., No. 3:21-cv-06468 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 27, 2023). The Court dismissed the complaint with prejudice for failure to plead falsity and failure to plead a strong inference of scienter. The Court had previously dismissed plaintiffs’ prior complaint without prejudice, in a decision covered here. Plaintiffs alleged that the Company, which offers products and services for consumers and merchants to send and receive digital payments, misled investors about its compliance with regulatory obligations, including its compliance with a consent order (the “Consent Order”) entered into with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) in 2015. According to plaintiffs, the Consent Order, which resolved claims that the Company enrolled students at for-profit colleges in the Company’s credit product without their knowledge, prohibited the Company from enrolling customers in its credit product without their affirmative consent. Plaintiffs alleged that the Company made false statements about its compliance with the Consent Order such as statements that the Company “continue[d] to cooperate and engage with the CFPB and work to ensure compliance with the Consent Order.” Plaintiffs also alleged that the Company’s executives falsely stated that they took allegations that for-profit educational institutions were misrepresenting the Company’s credit product “very seriously.” According to plaintiffs, the Company’s stock price dropped after the Company disclosed that it was under investigation by the SEC and CFPB for potential compliance failures. Although plaintiffs attempted to buttress the allegations in their complaint with evidence from a number of confidential witnesses (“CWs”), the Court did not find the additional facts to be persuasive. First, the Court held that the Company “had no obligation or requirement to elaborate on any alleged non-compliance because it had not yet been found to be noncompliant.” Second, the Court held that plaintiffs failed to plausibly plead that the Company actually violated a regulatory obligation. The Court noted that the CWs only “recall[ed] unsubstantiated and vague customer complaints, not actual violations.” And, although plaintiffs alleged that some third-party merchants misrepresented the Company’s credit product, “they never allege[d] that [the Company] did so.” Moreover, with respect to the Company’s affirmative statements about its compliance with regulatory obligations, the Court held these statements to be “the kind of corporate puffery that are rarely (if ever) actionably misleading.” With respect to scienter, the Court rejected plaintiffs’ argument that Company executives had knowledge of the alleged compliance failures, again pointing to the inadequacy of the CWs’ allegations. Specifically, the Court noted that “no CW attest[ed] to having first-hand knowledge of [the executives] knowing about a specific regulatory violation; instead, [the] allegations only show that [the executives] were aware of unsubstantiated and unspecified customer complaints.” Because plaintiffs failed to cure the deficiencies identified in the Court’s previous dismissal order, the Court held that further amendments would be futile and dismissed plaintiffs’ claims with prejudice.

Underwhelming margins at PayPal have been worrying analysts in recent quarters. The company's low-margin business products have grown strongly, while growth in its branded products has slowed due to increased pressure from competitors like Apple. \"When we think about the back half, in Q3, we'll still see some pressure on transaction margin performance. In Q4, we expect to see an improvement,\" acting CFO Gabrielle Rabinovitch said on a call with analysts. PayPal's adjusted operating margin for the quarter came in at 21.4%, missing its forecast of 22%. In a bright spot, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman said that as inflation cools the company expects discretionary spending to rebound and drive e-commerce growth. \"So one of the headwinds we faced was e-commerce growth slowing. Now it's accelerating again,\" he added. PayPal's total payment volume surged 11% in the second quarter to $376.5 billion, benefiting from resilient consumer spending trends. \"TPV growth above consensus affirms the ongoing theme of resilient consumer spending in the face of broader macroeconomic uncertainty,\" said Kevin Kennedy, analyst at research firm Third Bridge. Banking on the continued steady use of its platform, PayPal expects third-quarter revenue of about $7.4 billion, above analysts' estimates of $7.32 billion, according to Refinitiv data. PayPal forecast adjusted profit per share for the current quarter to be in a range of $1.22 and $1.24, above analysts' estimates of $1.22. PayPal posted revenue of $7.3 billion in the second quarter, compared with $6.8 billion last year. It earned $1.16 per share on an adjusted basis, in line with Wall Street expectations. Schulman also said the company was in the final stages of selecting his successor. His retirement was announced by PayPal in February.

PayPal reported fiscal 2023 second-quarter earnings per share (EPS) of $1.16, with revenue increasing 7% to $7.29 billion. Both were above analysts’ forecasts. However, adjusted operating margin fell to 21.4%, below the company’s previous estimate of 22%. PayPal blamed the miss on its credit portfolio, where revenue was less than expected and the firm increased its loss provisions. Acting CFO Gabrielle Rabinovitch noted that PayPal specifically faced pressure from its business loans. The company’s transaction fees also raised concerns, with PayPal’s take rate of 1.74% coming in below estimates. Rabinovitch added that the decision in June to sell the firm’s European buy now, pay later (BNPL) receivables to investment management firm KKR “helps optimize our balance sheet and is another example of disciplined capital allocation.” PayPal said it will receive about $1.8 billion of proceeds when the deal closes, which is expected before the end of the year. PayPal shares fell over 10% on Thursday morning following the news, dropping into negative territory for the year. YCharts",

        "content": "The PayPal logo is seen on a smartphone in front of the same logo displayed in this illustration By Sri Hari N S and Manya Saini (Reuters) -PayPal Holdings shares fell 7% in extended trading on Wednesday as investors were disappointed by the payments firm's quarterly operating margin, even as executives said they expect improvement towards the end of the year. Underwhelming margins at PayPal have been worrying analysts in recent quarters. The company's low-margin business products have grown strongly, while growth in its branded products has slowed due to increased pressure from competitors like Apple. \"When we think about the back half, in Q3, we'll still see some pressure on transaction margin performance. In Q4, we expect to see an improvement,\" acting CFO Gabrielle Rabinovitch said on a call with analysts. PayPal's adjusted operating margin for the quarter came in at 21.4%, missing its forecast of 22%. In a bright spot, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman said that as inflation cools the company expects discretionary spending to rebound and drive e-commerce growth. \"So one of the headwinds we faced was e-commerce growth slowing. Now it's accelerating again,\" he added. PayPal's total payment volume surged 11% in the second quarter to $376.5 billion, benefiting from resilient consumer spending trends. \"TPV growth above consensus affirms the ongoing theme of resilient consumer spending in the face of broader macroeconomic uncertainty,\" said Kevin Kennedy, analyst at research firm Third Bridge. Banking on the continued steady use of its platform, PayPal expects third-quarter revenue of about $7.4 billion, above analysts' estimates of $7.32 billion, according to Refinitiv data. PayPal forecast adjusted profit per share for the current quarter to be in a range of $1.22 and $1.24, above analysts' estimates of $1.22. PayPal posted revenue of $7.3 billion in the second quarter, compared with $6.8 billion last year. It earned $1.16 per share on an adjusted basis, in line with Wall Street expectations. Schulman also said the company was in the final stages of selecting his successor. His retirement was announced by PayPal in February.

        "content": "PayPal Holdings (PYPL) beat quarterly profit and sales estimates, but a drop in adjusted operating margin and money set aside to cover bad loans sent shares lower. PayPal reported fiscal 2023 second-quarter earnings per share (EPS) of $1.16, with revenue increasing 7% to $7.29 billion. Both were above analysts’ forecasts. However, adjusted operating margin fell to 21.4%, below the company’s previous estimate of 22%. PayPal blamed the miss on its credit portfolio, where revenue was less than expected and the firm increased its loss provisions. Acting CFO Gabrielle Rabinovitch noted that PayPal specifically faced pressure from its business loans. The company’s transaction fees also raised concerns, with PayPal’s take rate of 1.74% coming in below estimates. Rabinovitch added that the decision in June to sell the firm’s European buy now, pay later (BNPL) receivables to investment management firm KKR “helps optimize our balance sheet and is another example of disciplined capital allocation.” PayPal said it will receive about $1.8 billion of proceeds when the deal closes, which is expected before the end of the year. PayPal shares fell over 10% on Thursday morning following the news, dropping into negative territory for the year. YCharts"

PayPal shares were ahead 5.9% in afternoon trading, which would make for their largest one-day percentage rally since Nov. 10, 2022, according to Dow Jones Market Data. PayPal late Wednesday named its next chief financial officer, and its new chief executive, who started in late September, struck a chord with Wall Street as he talked up plans to deliver profitable growth. “We do not believe PYPL is a value trap, despite well-understood risks,” Truist Securities analyst Andrew Jeffrey wrote in a note to clients. “Our conviction in this comment reflects a view that PayPal still occupies an important position in the eCommerce ecosystem, embodied by dual consumer and merchant value propositions that are difficult for competitors to match.” PayPal shares are down 23% so far this year, as the S&P 500 SPX, +1.74% has increased 12%.",

PayPal shares were ahead 5.9% in afternoon trading, which would make for their largest one-day percentage rally since Nov. 10, 2022, according to Dow Jones Market Data. PayPal late Wednesday named its next chief financial officer, and its new chief executive, who started in late September, struck a chord with Wall Street as he talked up plans to deliver profitable growth. “We do not believe PYPL is a value trap, despite well-understood risks,” Truist Securities analyst Andrew Jeffrey wrote in a note to clients. “Our conviction in this comment reflects a view that PayPal still occupies an important position in the eCommerce ecosystem, embodied by dual consumer and merchant value propositions that are difficult for competitors to match.” PayPal shares are down 23% so far this year, as the S&P 500 SPX, +1.74% has increased 12%."

Spence vs Crawford, a fight first discussed in 2018 and desired by boxing fans ever since, was finally confirmed on Thursday (25 May), with the unbeaten Americans due to clash in Las Vegas on 29 July. Spence Jr, 33, will enter the T-Mobile Arena as unified welterweight champion, while Crawford, 35, holds the WBO title. As such, an undisputed champion will emerge from their contest, as long as it does not end as a draw. “Finally giving the fans what they want!” Spence Jr wrote on Instagram on Thursday. “This one [is] a throwback fight on paper but it could be a one sided a** whooping. One of the biggest fights of the century.” Meanwhile, fellow southpaw Crawford said in an Instagram video: “The wait is over, it’s game time [...] Everybody come out, show support, watch me fry this fish.” Spence Jr and Crawford were in talks last autumn over a November bout, but negotiations fell through, leading the latter to box David Avanesyan in December. Crawford stopped Avanesyan in Round 6, while Spence Jr last fought in April 2022, beating Yordenis Ugas in the 10th round.

ALCS gem latest reminder of puzzling Yankees decision SEATTLE — In his return from a 10-game suspension, Domingo German avoided enough bats and, more importantly, excessive stickiness on Monday night. German was not his sharpest, but was not his stickiest either, allowing him to pitch 6 ¹/₃ solid innings in the Yankees’ 10-4 win over the Mariners at T-Mobile Park. Making his first start since May 16 — when he failed a foreign-substance check in a game against the Blue Jays, leading to his ejection and automatic suspension — German’s hands figured to be heavily scrutinized Monday. But he appeared to breeze through his checks with umpires, apparently having found the acceptable amount of rosin. German insisted he used “about the same amount” of rosin as in his previous starts and that he was not feeling any pressure in his return from the suspension. “But there are times where [in] the game, maybe you don’t need to use some because you’re feeling comfortable executing pitches,” German said through an interpreter. Domingo German pitches during the Yankees’ win over the Mariners on May 29. USA TODAY Sports Domingo German’s hand is checked by an umpire during the Yankees’ win over the Mariners on May 29. AP The right-hander was checked for foreign substances after the first inning and before the fourth inning, and each time passed without any issues. “I was just focused on getting the job done today, executing pitches, staying calm through different situations in the game and I wanted to go as deep as possible,” German said. “Calm, clear plan of attack.” On a night when he gave up four runs on seven hits and three walks with four strikeouts, German was efficient with his pitch count as he worked into the seventh inning before being pulled. Heading into the game, the Yankees said they would be vigilant about the amount of rosin German had on his hands throughout his outing, including checks by pitching coach Matt Blake and others in the dugout. “He’s gotta be able to grab the rosin out there when he’s pitching,” manager Aaron Boone said before the game. “I’m not a pitcher, but a little bit of tack — I don’t think anyone’s looking to throw anyone out, but as long as you’re within the lines, I think you’re going to be fine.” Boone said there was still a “gray area” in terms of how much rosin was too much, but German was able to avoid finding out on Monday. “Overall, I thought he threw the ball well,” Boone said. “I thought his stuff was good. Probably not his best command, but to pitch us into the seventh, he got us off to a good start on this trip.”\n\n---\n\n[2023-05-31] 2023-05-31 06:46:16\n标题: Anthony Rizzo hoping to return to Yankees’ lineup soon\n内容: More On: new york yankees One area Yankees expect massive Anthony Volpe leap next season Liberty lose crusher as Aces win back-to-back WNBA titles The Yankees’ unraveling began one year ago — where do they go from here? ALCS gem latest reminder of puzzling Yankees decision SEATTLE — Anthony Rizzo woke up Monday morning with a stiff neck, but he felt fortunate that was the only repercussion from Fernando Tatis Jr. colliding with him on Sunday. The Yankees’ first baseman remained out of the lineup Tuesday night against the Mariners, but said he was feeling better and hoped to return either for the series finale Wednesday or the series opener against the Dodgers on Friday. “It could have been a lot worse, so thankful there was no concussion or anything like that,” Rizzo said before the Yankees beat the Mariners 10-2 at T-Mobile Park. The collision happened on a pickoff play, with Tatis remaining upright as he raced back to first base, where his leg thumped Rizzo’s neck. Rizzo declined to comment when asked if he had an issue with the way Tatis came back into the bag, calling it “just a hard play.” “I wasn’t expecting the bang-bang like that as far as him coming in standing,” Rizzo said. “Usually guys slide when it’s that close. Just startled, really, more than anything.” Anthony Rizzo, who injured his neck against the Padres in the Yankees’ home finale, is hoping to return for the final road game vs. the Mariners or against the Dodgers in the next series. Robert Sabo for NY Post Rizzo only received treatment Monday, but was hoping to ramp up more baseball activities to be in play for Wednesday. But the Yankees have Thursday off, so they could take the cautious route and hold him out until Friday. “That’s something we’ll consider, but if he’s ready to go, that’s another thing,” manager Aaron Boone said. “With the off day, it is something we would consider.” The Yankees moved on from Aaron Hicks, but he isn’t going far. The veteran outfielder signed a major league contract with the Orioles on Tuesday and could get a chance for more regular playing time in Baltimore with center fielder Cedric Mullins going on the injured list. “Hopefully that’s a good thing for him,” Boone said. “A lot of time here and a lot of good things happened for him here, despite the last couple years [being] a struggle. Hopefully it’s a good opportunity for him and certainly wish him well — not too well, being in our division and a team we’re chasing.” The Yankees, who designated Hicks for assignment on May 20, still owe him nearly $30 million. They will save about $480,000, which is the prorated major league minimum it cost the Orioles to sign Hicks. The Yankees and Orioles will next play July 3-6 in The Bronx. Jose Trevino was activated and went 0-for-4 with a walk after a short IL stint for a hamstring strain. Catcher Ben Rortvedt was optioned to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.\n\n---\n\n[2023-06-01] 2023-06-01 04:00:06\n标题: The ultimate Musk-have: satellite WiFi, naturally\n内容: The Hamptons is home to nine-figure estates, million-dollar golf-club memberships and $100-per-pound lobster salads. The 40-mile stretch offers residents the best money can buy. Except reliable broadband. “We’re in East Hampton, we’re one of the premiere destinations in the world,” Peter Corbett, an executive coach, tells me. “And there’s literally no cell service.” It’s well known that residents of tiny towns – from Martha’s Vineyard to Montauk – can’t count on a consistent communications connection. But a new solution is quietly taking off in the summer enclaves: Starlink, Elon Musk’s internet provider. Users only need a dish and a router, no fibre cable required. For a $599 dish and $120 in monthly fees, they can tap into Starlink’s constellation of satellites orbiting around 340 miles above Earth and access the internet. That might sound expensive for internet service, but it’s hard to put a price tag on a rich man’s need for speed. In Montauk, Hank Suominen works in commercial real estate and his wife owns an advertising firm. The two use video conferencing services regularly. “We dropped connections all the time because the system is kind of old,” he told me. They tried a 5G cellular solution, but it didn’t fare much better. So Suominen signed up for Starlink and got on the waiting list. Around three months later, the dish arrived. It’s hard to put a price tag on a rich man’s need for speed “For quite a stretch, it became our primary service,” he tells me. Similar to other Starlink customers in summer towns, Suominen pays for both the town’s main broadband provider and Starlink. As town internet providers lose out on their quasi-monopoly status thanks to alternative internet providers like Starlink, companies are beginning to invest more in boosting their service. Optimum has since upgraded Suominen’s home to a fibre connection. “I have a switch in the house that constantly monitors Optimum versus Starlink and it’s always going back and forth,” he says. Alex Karoussos, the owner of a Hamptons-based technology advisory, who is marketing Starlink to his Hamptonite clients, is betting that they will use Starlink in addition to another provider. “Our strategy is just to put it as an option for the house for redundant backup if you want it,” he tells me. © Gus Scott A short flight away in Nantucket, Steven Spencer, a partner at a trading firm based in midtown Manhattan, needs a strong internet connection in his Siasonset summer spot during market hours. He pays for two backups: Starlink and T-Mobile. Starlink “might become my primary as they add more satellites, but right now it’s still not perfect,” he told me. The United Nations’ International Telecommunication Union recently estimated that more than nine in 10 people have access to mobile broadband across the world, but that still leaves 390 million without. In Africa, nearly one in five people cannot access a mobile broadband network. In 2021, António Guterres, the secretary-general of the United Nations, advocated for universal access to the internet as a “basic human right”. SpaceX gifted Ukraine’s government about 20,000 Starlink units Starlink, which is operated by SpaceX (which declined to comment for this article), has signed up more than one million users in more than 30 countries since its first batch of satellites launched in May 2019. According to the company’s website, Starlink hopes to provide internet to “rural communities that have historically gone unserved by traditional internet service providers”. That includes everyone from influencers at The Surf Lodge in Montauk to the Ukrainian military (SpaceX gifted Ukraine’s government about 20,000 Starlink units, costing the company at least $80mn, according to a Musk tweet in October 2022). Most of Europe and North America, and parts of South America, are covered by the service, with noticeable gaps in Russia (perhaps not surprisingly), China and some parts of the United States. Starlink awaits regulatory approval in countries such as India and Pakistan. Providing internet hasn’t been smooth sailing. In the United States, the FCC denied Starlink nearly $1bn in subsidies because the company “failed to demonstrate [Starlink] could deliver the promised service”. Recommended HTSI Dyson’s new wheeze? An air purification system you wear on your head Musk’s service is beginning to take off in other exclusive vacation hotspots such as the Maldives and Antibes on the Côte d’Azur. As more people flock to summer enclaves full-time and working from home continues to accelerate, improving these towns’ internet connection becomes ever more pressing. As an executive coach, working from home, Corbett still has to leave his home to find somewhere where the connection is strong enough. “There have been times when I’m coaching CEOs of billion-dollar-plus companies in a parking lot in East Hampton village, because that’s where the cell service is strongest,” he says. Sounds like it’s time he looked to the stars.\n\n---\n\n[2023-06-02] 2023-06-02 10:46:00\n标题: This Is What Whales Are Betting On T-Mobile US\n内容: Someone with a lot of money to spend has taken a bearish stance on T-Mobile US TMUS.

German insisted he used “about the same amount” of rosin as in his previous starts and that he was not feeling any pressure in his return from the suspension. “But there are times where [in] the game, maybe you don’t need to use some because you’re feeling comfortable executing pitches,” German said through an interpreter. Domingo German pitches during the Yankees’ win over the Mariners on May 29. USA TODAY Sports Domingo German’s hand is checked by an umpire during the Yankees’ win over the Mariners on May 29. AP The right-hander was checked for foreign substances after the first inning and before the fourth inning, and each time passed without any issues. “I was just focused on getting the job done today, executing pitches, staying calm through different situations in the game and I wanted to go as deep as possible,” German said. “Calm, clear plan of attack.” On a night when he gave up four runs on seven hits and three walks with four strikeouts, German was efficient with his pitch count as he worked into the seventh inning before being pulled. Heading into the game, the Yankees said they would be vigilant about the amount of rosin German had on his hands throughout his outing, including checks by pitching coach Matt Blake and others in the dugout. “He’s gotta be able to grab the rosin out there when he’s pitching,” manager Aaron Boone said before the game. “I’m not a pitcher, but a little bit of tack — I don’t think anyone’s looking to throw anyone out, but as long as you’re within the lines, I think you’re going to be fine.” Boone said there was still a “gray area” in terms of how much rosin was too much, but German was able to avoid finding out on Monday. “Overall, I thought he threw the ball well,” Boone said. “I thought his stuff was good. Probably not his best command, but to pitch us into the seventh, he got us off to a good start on this trip.”"

ALCS gem latest reminder of puzzling Yankees decision SEATTLE — Anthony Rizzo woke up Monday morning with a stiff neck, but he felt fortunate that was the only repercussion from Fernando Tatis Jr. colliding with him on Sunday. The Yankees’ first baseman remained out of the lineup Tuesday night against the Mariners, but said he was feeling better and hoped to return either for the series finale Wednesday or the series opener against the Dodgers on Friday. “It could have been a lot worse, so thankful there was no concussion or anything like that,” Rizzo said before the Yankees beat the Mariners 10-2 at T-Mobile Park. The collision happened on a pickoff play, with Tatis remaining upright as he raced back to first base, where his leg thumped Rizzo’s neck. Rizzo declined to comment when asked if he had an issue with the way Tatis came back into the bag, calling it “just a hard play.” “I wasn’t expecting the bang-bang like that as far as him coming in standing,” Rizzo said. “Usually guys slide when it’s that close. Just startled, really, more than anything.” Anthony Rizzo, who injured his neck against the Padres in the Yankees’ home finale, is hoping to return for the final road game vs. the Mariners or against the Dodgers in the next series. Robert Sabo for NY Post Rizzo only received treatment Monday, but was hoping to ramp up more baseball activities to be in play for Wednesday. But the Yankees have Thursday off, so they could take the cautious route and hold him out until Friday. “That’s something we’ll consider, but if he’s ready to go, that’s another thing,” manager Aaron Boone said. “With the off day, it is something we would consider.” The Yankees moved on from Aaron Hicks, but he isn’t going far. The veteran outfielder signed a major league contract with the Orioles on Tuesday and could get a chance for more regular playing time in Baltimore with center fielder Cedric Mullins going on the injured list. “Hopefully that’s a good thing for him,” Boone said. “A lot of time here and a lot of good things happened for him here, despite the last couple years [being] a struggle. Hopefully it’s a good opportunity for him and certainly wish him well — not too well, being in our division and a team we’re chasing.” The Yankees, who designated Hicks for assignment on May 20, still owe him nearly $30 million. They will save about $480,000, which is the prorated major league minimum it cost the Orioles to sign Hicks. The Yankees and Orioles will next play July 3-6 in The Bronx.

        "title": "The ultimate Musk-have: satellite WiFi, naturally",
        "content": "The Hamptons is home to nine-figure estates, million-dollar golf-club memberships and $100-per-pound lobster salads. The 40-mile stretch offers residents the best money can buy. Except reliable broadband. “We’re in East Hampton, we’re one of the premiere destinations in the world,” Peter Corbett, an executive coach, tells me. “And there’s literally no cell service.” It’s well known that residents of tiny towns – from Martha’s Vineyard to Montauk – can’t count on a consistent communications connection. But a new solution is quietly taking off in the summer enclaves: Starlink, Elon Musk’s internet provider. Users only need a dish and a router, no fibre cable required. For a $599 dish and $120 in monthly fees, they can tap into Starlink’s constellation of satellites orbiting around 340 miles above Earth and access the internet. That might sound expensive for internet service, but it’s hard to put a price tag on a rich man’s need for speed. In Montauk, Hank Suominen works in commercial real estate and his wife owns an advertising firm. The two use video conferencing services regularly. “We dropped connections all the time because the system is kind of old,” he told me. They tried a 5G cellular solution, but it didn’t fare much better. So Suominen signed up for Starlink and got on the waiting list. Around three months later, the dish arrived. It’s hard to put a price tag on a rich man’s need for speed “For quite a stretch, it became our primary service,” he tells me. Similar to other Starlink customers in summer towns, Suominen pays for both the town’s main broadband provider and Starlink. As town internet providers lose out on their quasi-monopoly status thanks to alternative internet providers like Starlink, companies are beginning to invest more in boosting their service. Optimum has since upgraded Suominen’s home to a fibre connection. “I have a switch in the house that constantly monitors Optimum versus Starlink and it’s always going back and forth,” he says. Alex Karoussos, the owner of a Hamptons-based technology advisory, who is marketing Starlink to his Hamptonite clients, is betting that they will use Starlink in addition to another provider. “Our strategy is just to put it as an option for the house for redundant backup if you want it,” he tells me. © Gus Scott A short flight away in Nantucket, Steven Spencer, a partner at a trading firm based in midtown Manhattan, needs a strong internet connection in his Siasonset summer spot during market hours. He pays for two backups: Starlink and T-Mobile. Starlink “might become my primary as they add more satellites, but right now it’s still not perfect,” he told me. The United Nations’ International Telecommunication Union recently estimated that more than nine in 10 people have access to mobile broadband across the world, but that still leaves 390 million without. In Africa, nearly one in five people cannot access a mobile broadband network. In 2021, António Guterres, the secretary-general of the United Nations, advocated for universal access to the internet as a “basic human right”. SpaceX gifted Ukraine’s government about 20,000 Starlink units Starlink, which is operated by SpaceX (which declined to comment for this article), has signed up more than one million users in more than 30 countries since its first batch of satellites launched in May 2019. According to the company’s website, Starlink hopes to provide internet to “rural communities that have historically gone unserved by traditional internet service providers”. That includes everyone from influencers at The Surf Lodge in Montauk to the Ukrainian military (SpaceX gifted Ukraine’s government about 20,000 Starlink units, costing the company at least $80mn, according to a Musk tweet in October 2022). Most of Europe and North America, and parts of South America, are covered by the service, with noticeable gaps in Russia (perhaps not surprisingly), China and some parts of the United States. Starlink awaits regulatory approval in countries such as India and Pakistan. Providing internet hasn’t been smooth sailing. In the United States, the FCC denied Starlink nearly $1bn in subsidies because the company “failed to demonstrate [Starlink] could deliver the promised service”. Recommended HTSI Dyson’s new wheeze? An air purification system you wear on your head Musk’s service is beginning to take off in other exclusive vacation hotspots such as the Maldives and Antibes on the Côte d’Azur. As more people flock to summer enclaves full-time and working from home continues to accelerate, improving these towns’ internet connection becomes ever more pressing. As an executive coach, working from home, Corbett still has to leave his home to find somewhere where the connection is strong enough. “There have been times when I’m coaching CEOs of billion-dollar-plus companies in a parking lot in East Hampton village, because that’s where the cell service is strongest,” he says. Sounds like it’s time he looked to the stars."

Ratings come from analysts, or specialists within banking and financial systems that report for specific stocks or defined sectors (typically once per quarter for each stock). Analysts usually derive their information from company conference calls and meetings, financial statements, and conversations with important insiders to reach their decisions. Some analysts also offer predictions for helpful metrics such as earnings, revenue, and growth estimates to provide further guidance as to what to do with certain tickers. It is important to keep in mind that while stock and sector analysts are specialists, they are also human and can only forecast their beliefs to traders.

Some analysts also offer predictions for helpful metrics such as earnings, revenue, and growth estimates to provide further guidance as to what to do with certain tickers.

But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. Long term T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 119% in five years. On the other hand, we note it's down 8.2% in about a month. In light of the stock dropping 6.2% in the past week, we want to investigate the longer term story, and see if fundamentals have been the driver of the company's positive five-year return. Check out our latest analysis for T-Mobile US To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS). During five years of share price growth, T-Mobile US actually saw its EPS drop 9.8% per year. Essentially, it doesn't seem likely that investors are focused on EPS. Because earnings per share don't seem to match up with the share price, we'll take a look at other metrics instead. In contrast revenue growth of 17% per year is probably viewed as evidence that T-Mobile US is growing, a real positive. In that case, the company may be sacrificing current earnings per share to drive growth. The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail). earnings-and-revenue-growth T-Mobile US is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth.

Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 17%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

And that turns out to be pretty good business. At T-Mobile we have a simple mission - to be the best in the world at connecting customers to their world. It inspires us to use our network, scale and resources to drive transformational improvements for our customers and employees, society and the planet. Our extraordinary success in 2022 enabled us to invest back in T-Mobile customers with a strategy to deliver the best network, best value and best experiences. We also upheld our promises to connect more people, in more places, than ever before. For years, the other guys have overlooked and underserved America's small towns and rural areas, but the Un-carrier is different. We believe reliable and affordable wireless and internet service is a necessity for ALL in today's highly connected, digital world. When we deliver speed, choice and value to people and businesses across the country, we improve access to essential services, enable more efficient commerce, expand education and employment opportunities, and empower innovation. That's why we are so committed to Project 10Million, our $10.7 billion initiative to offer connectivity to up to 10 million eligible student households that lack equal access to the internet. We've made tremendous progress with Project 10Million and other education programs to help close the digital divide, connecting more than 5.3 million students and equipping them with free or highly subsidized service so they can have access where and when they need it. And, in partnership with Welcome.US, we pledged to provide up to 200,000 lines of service to Ukrainian and Afghan refugees entering the U.S. It's difficult to imagine restarting a new life in a new country without the connectivity most of us take for granted. Story continues As we build the nation's largest, fastest and most-awarded 5G network, managing our environmental footprint is another top priority - something we know is important to our employees, customers and other stakeholders. Earlier this year, we announced an ambitious sustainability goal to achieve net-zero emissions across our ENTIRE carbon footprint by 2040. We set a high bar for ourselves, but tackling big problems with bold solutions is who we are - it's in our DNA. All of these efforts are made possible thanks to the amazing employees who bring T-Mobile's welcoming, celebratory culture to life. They love our customers and champion diversity, equity and inclusion within our walls and out in the world. Together, we're making progress on our five-year Equity in Action Plan, a set of 54 goals we created in 2020 to support genuine, positive experiences for everyone. We recognize that our company can't be its best unless everyone can come to work as their authentic, best self. 2022 was an unforgettable year for T-Mobile, backed by our relentless passion for acting as a force for good, connecting people who need it most, and creating opportunity for all. It's a new era of the Un-carrier, and as a T-Mobile team getting better and stronger each year, we're committed to making an even bigger impact on the lives of our customers, our communities and the planet.

The firm reinstated T-Mobile to its list of top picks in telecommunications services. Analyst Simon Flannery maintained his overweight rating on shares, while increasing his price target by $1 to $178. His target price implies 39% upside from where shares closed Thursday. \"T-Mobile is one of the only companies in our coverage (along with Iridium) with a sizable buyback program who is able to take advantage of market volatility. The company offers investors low leverage, strong FCF generation, a recurring revenue model, network leadership, growing market share and reasonable valuations,\" Flannery wrote in a Thursday note. The analyst said the recent weakness in the telecom services sector creates an opportunity for T-Mobile to execute the rest of its $14 billion share buyback program at lower prices, \"creating more value for shareholders.\" Flannery noted temporary headwinds from wholesale traffic offloading by DISH and Verizon are temporary headwinds to T-Mobile shares. The company's ability to outperform the sector may become harder as it gains more market share, he added. Shares are down more than 8% year to date. The stock is still up 1.2% over the past 12 months. Morgan Stanley said it expects the stock \"to break out of this range over the next few months driven by operating and technical factors.\" The firm expects T-Mobile to continue to take share in the wireless industry while its newly launched 5G plan supports service revenue growth.

        "title": "Connecting With Purpose: T-Mobile Releases 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report",
        "content": "NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / June 12, 2023 / T-Mobile: Originally published in T-Mobile's 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report We started the \"Un-carrier\" movement 10 years ago to focus on the unmet needs of wireless customers and above all else, to never stand for \"good enough,\" an all-too-common approach among the \"Carriers.\" A decade later, we're still doing the right thing by offering real solutions that make a difference in our customers' lives. And that turns out to be pretty good business. At T-Mobile we have a simple mission - to be the best in the world at connecting customers to their world. It inspires us to use our network, scale and resources to drive transformational improvements for our customers and employees, society and the planet. Our extraordinary success in 2022 enabled us to invest back in T-Mobile customers with a strategy to deliver the best network, best value and best experiences. We also upheld our promises to connect more people, in more places, than ever before. For years, the other guys have overlooked and underserved America's small towns and rural areas, but the Un-carrier is different. We believe reliable and affordable wireless and internet service is a necessity for ALL in today's highly connected, digital world. When we deliver speed, choice and value to people and businesses across the country, we improve access to essential services, enable more efficient commerce, expand education and employment opportunities, and empower innovation. That's why we are so committed to Project 10Million, our $10.7 billion initiative to offer connectivity to up to 10 million eligible student households that lack equal access to the internet. We've made tremendous progress with Project 10Million and other education programs to help close the digital divide, connecting more than 5.3 million students and equipping them with free or highly subsidized service so they can have access where and when they need it. And, in partnership with Welcome.US, we pledged to provide up to 200,000 lines of service to Ukrainian and Afghan refugees entering the U.S. It's difficult to imagine restarting a new life in a new country without the connectivity most of us take for granted. Story continues As we build the nation's largest, fastest and most-awarded 5G network, managing our environmental footprint is another top priority - something we know is important to our employees, customers and other stakeholders. Earlier this year, we announced an ambitious sustainability goal to achieve net-zero emissions across our ENTIRE carbon footprint by 2040. We set a high bar for ourselves, but tackling big problems with bold solutions is who we are - it's in our DNA. All of these efforts are made possible thanks to the amazing employees who bring T-Mobile's welcoming, celebratory culture to life. They love our customers and champion diversity, equity and inclusion within our walls and out in the world. Together, we're making progress on our five-year Equity in Action Plan, a set of 54 goals we created in 2020 to support genuine, positive experiences for everyone. We recognize that our company can't be its best unless everyone can come to work as their authentic, best self. 2022 was an unforgettable year for T-Mobile, backed by our relentless passion for acting as a force for good, connecting people who need it most, and creating opportunity for all. It's a new era of the Un-carrier, and as a T-Mobile team getting better and stronger each year, we're committed to making an even bigger impact on the lives of our customers, our communities and the planet.

        "content": "T-Mobile (TMUS) closed at $129.88 in the latest trading session, marking a -0.69% move from the prior day. This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.69% gain on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.43%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 8.94%. Coming into today, shares of the wireless carrier had lost 9.57% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 10.86%, while the S&P 500 gained 5.41%. Investors will be hoping for strength from T-Mobile as it approaches its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect T-Mobile to post earnings of $1.71 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 19.58%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $19.33 billion, down 1.88% from the year-ago period. For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $6.98 per share and revenue of $79.12 billion, which would represent changes of +238.83% and -0.56%, respectively, from the prior year. It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for T-Mobile. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook. Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model. Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.14% higher within the past month. T-Mobile is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Valuation is also important, so investors should note that T-Mobile has a Forward P/E ratio of 18.72 right now. This valuation marks a no noticeable deviation compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 18.72. Story continues It is also worth noting that TMUS currently has a PEG ratio of 0.6. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Wireless National was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.28 at yesterday's closing price. The Wireless National industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 173, which puts it in the bottom 32% of all 250+ industries.

        "title": "Morgan Stanley reinstates this mobile carrier as a top pick, says shares could surge nearly 40%",
        "content": "\"Patience should be rewarded,\" Morgan Stanley said about T-Mobile shares. The firm reinstated T-Mobile to its list of top picks in telecommunications services. Analyst Simon Flannery maintained his overweight rating on shares, while increasing his price target by $1 to $178. His target price implies 39% upside from where shares closed Thursday. \"T-Mobile is one of the only companies in our coverage (along with Iridium) with a sizable buyback program who is able to take advantage of market volatility. The company offers investors low leverage, strong FCF generation, a recurring revenue model, network leadership, growing market share and reasonable valuations,\" Flannery wrote in a Thursday note. The analyst said the recent weakness in the telecom services sector creates an opportunity for T-Mobile to execute the rest of its $14 billion share buyback program at lower prices, \"creating more value for shareholders.\" Flannery noted temporary headwinds from wholesale traffic offloading by DISH and Verizon are temporary headwinds to T-Mobile shares. The company's ability to outperform the sector may become harder as it gains more market share, he added. Shares are down more than 8% year to date. The stock is still up 1.2% over the past 12 months. Morgan Stanley said it expects the stock \"to break out of this range over the next few months driven by operating and technical factors.\" The firm expects T-Mobile to continue to take share in the wireless industry while its newly launched 5G plan supports service revenue growth.

Chen Jimin—China News Service/VCG/Getty Images Looking to buy an electric vehicle now that the U.S. government is offering $7,500, but you don’t know which ones qualify? On Tuesday, President Joe Biden posted a link to the page on the Internal Revenue Service website that lists all cars that, at least in theory, are eligible. “Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, folks who purchase electric vehicles can receive a federal tax credit of up to $7,500 per vehicle, allowing millions of consumers to ditch the pump and easily switch to an EV,” he celebrated. Suffice to say this is a slight exaggeration. First off, simply picking from the various vehicle models listed won’t do—it’s a bit more complicated than that. Each nameplate cannot exceed a certain price threshold depending on whether it’s classified either as a passenger car or a light-duty vehicle, such as more expensive SUVs and pickup trucks. That’s why only Tesla’s entry version Model 3 with a single motor is eligible for the credit. Its $46,990 price tag comes in below the applicable manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) limit of $55,000 listed on the IRS page. The Cadillac Lyriq is also listed by the IRS, but since it starts at $62,990, only a hefty price cut by General Motors will mean it qualifies. Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, folks who purchase electric vehicles can receive a tax credit of up to $7,500 per vehicle, allowing millions of consumers to ditch the pump and easily switch to an EV. Take a look: https://t.co/rF5wXSF5DF — President Biden (@POTUS) January 3, 2023 So it’s important to always cross-reference the car with the current MSRP found on a carmaker’s website. There are a few more peculiarities of which potential buyers should be aware. The administration first needed to determine what can be considered an electric vehicle. For instance, a fuel cell car like the Toyota Mirai that starts at $49,500 doesn’t use a battery, and yet it is electric, making it a potential contender. Too bad it’s manufactured outside the North American continent then, putting it out of the running. For those vehicles that run on high-voltage traction batteries, by comparison, the bar for what can be deemed “electric” in the eyes of the IRS was set absurdly low by the government. That is no coincidence since it allows for the much-maligned plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), which rarely offer a usable electric range, to clear the hurdle. For that reason, Audi’s $57,400 turbocharged Q5 Quattro SUV with permanent all-wheel drive imported from the carmaker’s plant in Mexico can count on the support of U.S. taxpayers despite its microscopic range of just 23 miles on one charge. The same goes for the Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe SUV that costs $60,360 and manages 25 miles before having to fire up the internal combustion engine. All a PHEV needs to prove is that its battery has a capacity of at least seven kilowatt-hours. To put this into perspective, most battery electric vehicles (BEVs) come with a minimum 50 kWh battery pack, and some like the BMW iX or Mercedes EQS are even twice that size. This elicits understandable criticism as it’s entirely possible (though inadvisable given fuel prices) that they can be driven without ever charging the battery at all. Is a crossover a car or an SUV? The final peculiarity is the issue of what precisely constitutes a light vehicle, and here is where Tesla is at a material disadvantage. Elon Musk’s hugely popular Model Y does not—at least presently—qualify since the crossover is considered by the IRS under long-standing rules to be a car under its sheet metal and not an SUV. Aspects like its approach angle doesn’t allow it to scale rocky terrain, nor is its ground clearance sufficient to allow for off-road driving. Without this, the Model Y is subject to the $55,000 MSRP cap for passenger cars rather than the more generous $80,000 threshold for light vehicles. Currently, the most affordable Model Y starts at $65,990 so Tesla would have to knock off nearly a fifth of the price; it would be cheaper just to offer the $7,500 as a rebate off the hood than attempt to qualify. That is, unless the Y is purchased in its optional seven-seat configuration for an extra $3,000, which the IRS then classifies as a light-duty vehicle.

    "news_context": "[2023-01-20] 2023-01-20 00:00:00\n标题: Musk's Tesla Stock Sale May Trigger Trading Probe\n内容: Elon Musk's sale of Tesla (TSLA) stock last month shortly before the maker of electric vehicles missed Wall Street targets for annual deliveries is suspicious enough to warrant an insider trading probe, legal experts told The Wall Street Journal. Musk, Tesla's CEO, reported selling 22 million shares for a total of nearly $3.6 billion between Dec. 12 and Dec. 14. Musk started those sales a week after Bloomberg reported Tesla planned to lower output at its Shanghai factory, and four days after the same news service reported the company was shortening working shifts at the plant in the latest sign Chinese demand for Tesla's electric cars was falling short of expectations. On Jan. 2, Tesla reported fourth-quarter delivery numbers well short of the company's forecast as well as analysts' expectations, triggering a 12% share price drop in the first trading session of 2023. Musk gained about $1.2 billion by selling the stock in mid-December at an average of about $163 per share over what he would have realized at the Jan. 3 closing price of $108.10 per share. Insider trading experts told the Wall Street Journal the circumstances are sufficient to trigger a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) probe. \"Is it suspicious? Yes. Is it entirely possible there are other explanations? Of course. But that's what the enforcement process is all about,” the newspaper quoted Georgetown University securities law professor Donald Langevoort as saying. \"This should be of great interest to the SEC. The issue here is, what did he know and what was the market anticipating when he sold,” Duke University securities law professor James Cox told the Journal. The SEC declined to comment while Musk and Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment, according to the newspaper. December's share sales increased Musk's proceeds from selling Tesla stock to almost $23 billion for 2022 and more than $39 billion since November 2021. Tesla shares fell 65% in 2022, costing shareholders $700 billion. At various points last year, Musk suggested he was done selling or said Tesla's stock was an attractive buy before selling more. The 2022 sales took place before and after Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion in October. Musk's filing following December's share sale didn't indicate whether it was part of a preset insider trading plan. SEC rules adopted last month to crack down on abuses under such plans will require corporate insiders to indicate in reporting sales whether they were made under such a plan. The new rules for the so-called 10b5-1 plans take effect April 1. If the SEC looks into Musk's December sale it reportedly won't be the first time it has targeted the regulation-averse tycoon in an insider trading probe. In February, the Wall Street Journal reported the agency was investigating Elon Musk and his brother Kimbal Musk over the latter's sales of Tesla shares worth $108 million shortly before Elon Musk posted a Twitter poll asking whether he should sell 10% of his stake in Tesla, ostensibly to pay taxes. Musk said at the time the idea that he would warn his brother about the poll to help him avoid selling his shares \"for a few million less\" was \"utterly absurd.\" Separately, Musk ran afoul of the SEC as well as the Federal Trade Commission in March when he acquired a 5% stake in Twitter but didn't disclose it immediately, taking at least 10 days to make the share purchases public. The delay allowed Musk to buy additional Twitter shares without alerting sellers that he had already accumulated a stake subject to the disclosure. As with the Musk insider trading probe reportedly launched last year, there has been no news on the investigation since. Musk's contentious relationship with the SEC dates back to a 2018 settlement with the agency by Musk and Tesla over a Musk tweet claiming \"funding secured\" for a buyout of Tesla that proved to be false. Musk and Tesla paid $20 million each to settle the case, and Musk agreed to step down as Tesla chair and to allow Tesla's lawyers to review his material tweets about the company before posting. Musk has since sought unsuccessfully to invalidate the settlement in court. He also faces a class-action shareholder suit that's underway in San Francisco over the losses Tesla shares sustained in the wake of his \"funding secured\" tweet.\n\n---\n\n[2023-01-23] 2023-01-23 00:00:00\n标题: Tesla Probably Had Weakest Quarterly Profit, Revenue Gains in Three Years\n内容: Elon Musk's Tesla Inc. (TSLA), last year's worst-performing stock in the S&P 500, may underpin that performance by saying this week that fourth-quarter profit rose at the slowest pace in three years amid weaker demand and logistical issues. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) likely rose 41% to $1.19 from a year ago, according to estimates from Visible Alpha. Revenue probably increased almost 38% to $24.4 billion, the slowest pace of growth since mid-2020. Tesla announces results after markets close on Jan. 25. The electric vehicle (EV) company dealt with a slew of internal issues in recent months including COVID-related logistics trouble and supply chain problems. Musk, the CEO, has stirred controversy with his takeover of Twitter, prompting some Tesla shareholders to call for his ouster. Musk also faces scrutiny from regulators, including a possible trading probe over shares he sold in December and a trial over allegations that he lied about potential plans to take Tesla private in 2018. Externally, increased competition from rival EV makers, a cooling economy, and tepid demand among Chinese customers prompted Tesla to slash prices on several models in early January in a bid to win business.

Some of Musk’s shareholders have grumbled over his simultaneous leadership of multiple companies, with some Tesla investors arguing that his leadership of Twitter hurts Tesla’s brand and drags down its stock price. Tesla shares had a dismal 2022, falling 65% in their biggest-ever annual decline. Yet shares in the electric-car maker have since rebounded, up 33.6% from the start of the year. Tesla reported $24.32 billion of fourth-quarter revenue on Wednesday, beating expectations and up by around a third year on year. Musk has pushed back against assertions that he can’t manage Tesla and Twitter at the same time. At a Twitter Spaces session last December, Musk told listeners that he hadn’t missed “a single important Tesla meeting” since becoming CEO of Twitter. And on a call with analysts on Wednesday, Musk described his Twitter feed as an asset, calling it “an incredibly powerful tool for driving demand for Tesla.” Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company reportedly no longer has a communications department. Free-speech absolutist Blocking links to the BBC documentary India: The Modi Question is an early test for the new Elon Musk–led Twitter and how it handles social media regulations overseas. The documentary examines Modi’s actions during anti-Muslim riots in the state of Gujarat in 2002, while he was chief minister of the state. Victims of the riots have accused Modi of tolerating, or even encouraging, the violence. Modi denies the allegations, and the country’s judiciary has declined to prosecute. Indian officials called the documentary a “propaganda piece” and “anti-India garbage.” Officials have clamped down on screenings of the documentary on university campuses, according to the Associated Press. The BBC called the documentary “rigorously researched” in a statement. Indian officials have ordered social media platforms, like YouTube and Twitter, to take down links to the documentary for Indian audiences, reports The Intercept. (Users outside of India can still access the film.) In February 2021, India ordered social media companies to designate local executives responsible for complying with government requests to take down content, or to challenge them in court. These officers could face jail time if they did not comply with such orders within 36 hours. In May that same year, Indian law enforcement raided Twitter’s India offices after the social media platform dubbed a tweet from a member of India’s ruling party “manipulated media.” India was the fifth-largest source of removal requests for Twitter, according to the social media company’s latest transparency report, which covers June through December 2021, behind Japan, Russia, Turkey, and South Korea. Yet India led in terms of removal requests targeted at verified journalists and media outlets, Twitter reported. The Indian government is formulating new rules that would grant officials more power to deem information “fake or false,” and bar social media platforms from hosting it. Musk has called himself a “free-speech absolutist.” After taking over as Twitter CEO, he has revoked the suspensions of figures like former U.S. President Donald Trump in what he termed a “general amnesty.” But at other times, Musk has said that Twitter would follow local laws, even if they impinged on speech and content. “By ‘free speech,’ I simply mean that which matches the law,” he tweeted in April. He then claimed that “if people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect.”\n\n---\n\n[2023-01-26] 2023-01-26 00:03:31\n标题: Great News!

        "title": "Musk's Tesla Stock Sale May Trigger Trading Probe",
        "content": "Elon Musk's sale of Tesla (TSLA) stock last month shortly before the maker of electric vehicles missed Wall Street targets for annual deliveries is suspicious enough to warrant an insider trading probe, legal experts told The Wall Street Journal. Musk, Tesla's CEO, reported selling 22 million shares for a total of nearly $3.6 billion between Dec. 12 and Dec. 14. Musk started those sales a week after Bloomberg reported Tesla planned to lower output at its Shanghai factory, and four days after the same news service reported the company was shortening working shifts at the plant in the latest sign Chinese demand for Tesla's electric cars was falling short of expectations. On Jan. 2, Tesla reported fourth-quarter delivery numbers well short of the company's forecast as well as analysts' expectations, triggering a 12% share price drop in the first trading session of 2023. Musk gained about $1.2 billion by selling the stock in mid-December at an average of about $163 per share over what he would have realized at the Jan. 3 closing price of $108.10 per share. Insider trading experts told the Wall Street Journal the circumstances are sufficient to trigger a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) probe. \"Is it suspicious? Yes. Is it entirely possible there are other explanations? Of course. But that's what the enforcement process is all about,” the newspaper quoted Georgetown University securities law professor Donald Langevoort as saying. \"This should be of great interest to the SEC. The issue here is, what did he know and what was the market anticipating when he sold,” Duke University securities law professor James Cox told the Journal. The SEC declined to comment while Musk and Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment, according to the newspaper. December's share sales increased Musk's proceeds from selling Tesla stock to almost $23 billion for 2022 and more than $39 billion since November 2021. Tesla shares fell 65% in 2022, costing shareholders $700 billion. At various points last year, Musk suggested he was done selling or said Tesla's stock was an attractive buy before selling more. The 2022 sales took place before and after Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion in October. Musk's filing following December's share sale didn't indicate whether it was part of a preset insider trading plan. SEC rules adopted last month to crack down on abuses under such plans will require corporate insiders to indicate in reporting sales whether they were made under such a plan. The new rules for the so-called 10b5-1 plans take effect April 1. If the SEC looks into Musk's December sale it reportedly won't be the first time it has targeted the regulation-averse tycoon in an insider trading probe. In February, the Wall Street Journal reported the agency was investigating Elon Musk and his brother Kimbal Musk over the latter's sales of Tesla shares worth $108 million shortly before Elon Musk posted a Twitter poll asking whether he should sell 10% of his stake in Tesla, ostensibly to pay taxes. Musk said at the time the idea that he would warn his brother about the poll to help him avoid selling his shares \"for a few million less\" was \"utterly absurd.\" Separately, Musk ran afoul of the SEC as well as the Federal Trade Commission in March when he acquired a 5% stake in Twitter but didn't disclose it immediately, taking at least 10 days to make the share purchases public. The delay allowed Musk to buy additional Twitter shares without alerting sellers that he had already accumulated a stake subject to the disclosure. As with the Musk insider trading probe reportedly launched last year, there has been no news on the investigation since. Musk's contentious relationship with the SEC dates back to a 2018 settlement with the agency by Musk and Tesla over a Musk tweet claiming \"funding secured\" for a buyout of Tesla that proved to be false. Musk and Tesla paid $20 million each to settle the case, and Musk agreed to step down as Tesla chair and to allow Tesla's lawyers to review his material tweets about the company before posting. Musk has since sought unsuccessfully to invalidate the settlement in court. He also faces a class-action shareholder suit that's underway in San Francisco over the losses Tesla shares sustained in the wake of his \"funding secured\" tweet."

TSLA stock declined over 65% in 2022, underperforming the NASDAQ 100 (NDX) index. According to the report, the recent volatility in Tesla stock and increased competition led the investment management company to reduce its holdings in TSLA stock to below 2% of the net asset value from over 9%. The fund’s lead manager, Hwang Woo-Taek, also listed Tesla’s high valuation and Elon Musk’s sale of TSLA stock to fund the Twitter acquisition as reasons for the reduction in holdings. Tesla stock is trading at a forward P/E (Price/Earnings) multiple of 32.63, much higher than the sector median of 14.28. Further, Tesla’s growth could moderate due to increased competition from traditional automakers. While the fund cut its holdings in TSLA stock, Bloomberg reported earlier that South Korean retail investors had amassed Tesla shares worth $2.8 billion. What Do Analysts Say About Tesla Stock? Though Tesla faces challenges, Wall Street remains bullish about its prospects. TSLA stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on TipRanks based on 20 Buys, nine Holds, and three Sells. TSLA’s price target of $230.99 implies 78.82% upside potential.

Some of Musk’s shareholders have grumbled over his simultaneous leadership of multiple companies, with some Tesla investors arguing that his leadership of Twitter hurts Tesla’s brand and drags down its stock price. Tesla shares had a dismal 2022, falling 65% in their biggest-ever annual decline. Yet shares in the electric-car maker have since rebounded, up 33.6% from the start of the year.

Musk has pushed back against assertions that he can’t manage Tesla and Twitter at the same time. At a Twitter Spaces session last December, Musk told listeners that he hadn’t missed “a single important Tesla meeting” since becoming CEO of Twitter.

Victims of the riots have accused Modi of tolerating, or even encouraging, the violence. Modi denies the allegations, and the country’s judiciary has declined to prosecute.

        "content": "Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has dropped out of the top 10 holdings of the South Korean EV-focused mutual fund, Bloomberg reported. TSLA stock declined over 65% in 2022, underperforming the NASDAQ 100 (NDX) index. According to the report, the recent volatility in Tesla stock and increased competition led the investment management company to reduce its holdings in TSLA stock to below 2% of the net asset value from over 9%. The fund’s lead manager, Hwang Woo-Taek, also listed Tesla’s high valuation and Elon Musk’s sale of TSLA stock to fund the Twitter acquisition as reasons for the reduction in holdings. Tesla stock is trading at a forward P/E (Price/Earnings) multiple of 32.63, much higher than the sector median of 14.28. Further, Tesla’s growth could moderate due to increased competition from traditional automakers. While the fund cut its holdings in TSLA stock, Bloomberg reported earlier that South Korean retail investors had amassed Tesla shares worth $2.8 billion. What Do Analysts Say About Tesla Stock? Though Tesla faces challenges, Wall Street remains bullish about its prospects. TSLA stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on TipRanks based on 20 Buys, nine Holds, and three Sells. TSLA’s price target of $230.99 implies 78.82% upside potential. Disclosure"

        "title": "Musk's Tesla Stock Sale May Trigger Trading Probe",
        "content": "Elon Musk's sale of Tesla (TSLA) stock last month shortly before the maker of electric vehicles missed Wall Street targets for annual deliveries is suspicious enough to warrant an insider trading probe, legal experts told The Wall Street Journal. Musk, Tesla's CEO, reported selling 22 million shares for a total of nearly $3.6 billion between Dec. 12 and Dec. 14. Musk started those sales a week after Bloomberg reported Tesla planned to lower output at its Shanghai factory, and four days after the same news service reported the company was shortening working shifts at the plant in the latest sign Chinese demand for Tesla's electric cars was falling short of expectations. On Jan. 2, Tesla reported fourth-quarter delivery numbers well short of the company's forecast as well as analysts' expectations, triggering a 12% share price drop in the first trading session of 2023. Musk gained about $1.2 billion by selling the stock in mid-December at an average of about $163 per share over what he would have realized at the Jan. 3 closing price of $108.10 per share. Insider trading experts told the Wall Street Journal the circumstances are sufficient to trigger a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) probe. \"Is it suspicious? Yes. Is it entirely possible there are other explanations? Of course. But that's what the enforcement process is all about,” the newspaper quoted Georgetown University securities law professor Donald Langevoort as saying. \"This should be of great interest to the SEC. The issue here is, what did he know and what was the market anticipating when he sold,” Duke University securities law professor James Cox told the Journal. The SEC declined to comment while Musk and Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment, according to the newspaper. December's share sales increased Musk's proceeds from selling Tesla stock to almost $23 billion for 2022 and more than $39 billion since November 2021. Tesla shares fell 65% in 2022, costing shareholders $700 billion. At various points last year, Musk suggested he was done selling or said Tesla's stock was an attractive buy before selling more. The 2022 sales took place before and after Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion in October. Musk's filing following December's share sale didn't indicate whether it was part of a preset insider trading plan. SEC rules adopted last month to crack down on abuses under such plans will require corporate insiders to indicate in reporting sales whether they were made under such a plan. The new rules for the so-called 10b5-1 plans take effect April 1. If the SEC looks into Musk's December sale it reportedly won't be the first time it has targeted the regulation-averse tycoon in an insider trading probe. In February, the Wall Street Journal reported the agency was investigating Elon Musk and his brother Kimbal Musk over the latter's sales of Tesla shares worth $108 million shortly before Elon Musk posted a Twitter poll asking whether he should sell 10% of his stake in Tesla, ostensibly to pay taxes. Musk said at the time the idea that he would warn his brother about the poll to help him avoid selling his shares \"for a few million less\" was \"utterly absurd.\" Separately, Musk ran afoul of the SEC as well as the Federal Trade Commission in March when he acquired a 5% stake in Twitter but didn't disclose it immediately, taking at least 10 days to make the share purchases public. The delay allowed Musk to buy additional Twitter shares without alerting sellers that he had already accumulated a stake subject to the disclosure. As with the Musk insider trading probe reportedly launched last year, there has been no news on the investigation since. Musk's contentious relationship with the SEC dates back to a 2018 settlement with the agency by Musk and Tesla over a Musk tweet claiming \"funding secured\" for a buyout of Tesla that proved to be false. Musk and Tesla paid $20 million each to settle the case, and Musk agreed to step down as Tesla chair and to allow Tesla's lawyers to review his material tweets about the company before posting. Musk has since sought unsuccessfully to invalidate the settlement in court. He also faces a class-action shareholder suit that's underway in San Francisco over the losses Tesla shares sustained in the wake of his \"funding secured\" tweet."

        "title": "Tesla Probably Had Weakest Quarterly Profit, Revenue Gains in Three Years",
        "content": "Elon Musk's Tesla Inc. (TSLA), last year's worst-performing stock in the S&P 500, may underpin that performance by saying this week that fourth-quarter profit rose at the slowest pace in three years amid weaker demand and logistical issues. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) likely rose 41% to $1.19 from a year ago, according to estimates from Visible Alpha. Revenue probably increased almost 38% to $24.4 billion, the slowest pace of growth since mid-2020. Tesla announces results after markets close on Jan. 25. The electric vehicle (EV) company dealt with a slew of internal issues in recent months including COVID-related logistics trouble and supply chain problems. Musk, the CEO, has stirred controversy with his takeover of Twitter, prompting some Tesla shareholders to call for his ouster. Musk also faces scrutiny from regulators, including a possible trading probe over shares he sold in December and a trial over allegations that he lied about potential plans to take Tesla private in 2018. Externally, increased competition from rival EV makers, a cooling economy, and tepid demand among Chinese customers prompted Tesla to slash prices on several models in early January in a bid to win business. What's more, Tesla announced at the start of the year that it came up short of analyst estimates for new cars delivered in the last quarter. Tesla shares plunged by almost two-thirds last year.
