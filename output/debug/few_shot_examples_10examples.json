We expect earnings to stand at about $1.07 per share, slightly below consensus estimates. On the other hand, we expect revenues to come in about $74 billion, marking a decline of about 11% versus last year and marginally ahead of consensus estimates. So what are some of the trends that are likely to drive Apple’s results for the quarter? See our analysis on Apple Earnings Preview for a closer look at what to expect when Apple publishes earnings. While Q3 is typically a seasonally weak quarter for Apple, we expect sales of products such as the Mac and iPad to also decline year-over-year, as the remote working trend eases and the broader PC and tablet markets cool. For perspective, over Q2 FY’23, Apple’s Mac sales declined by about 31% year-over-year. However, sales of the iPhone could prove a bit more resilient, given the traction that Apple is seeing in markets such as India, Indonesia, and Turkey where installment plans and trade-in programs are helping drive demand. Apple’s digital services business should partly help Apple ride out the lull in its hardware business driven by higher sales at the AppStore and improving the uptake of other subscription services. However, growth rates are likely to remain below the levels seen last year. That said, it is likely that Apple will continue to expand its gross margins for the quarter driven by a higher mix of service sales, more premium products, and also due to some cost savings. While Apple stock could move higher if it beats earnings, we believe that the stock is overvalued at current levels of about $195 per share. Apple currently trades at over 35x forward earnings, which is high relative to historical levels. Moreover, Apple’s earnings are poised to contract this year per consensus estimates, with revenue growth projected to remain slow over the next year as well. We value Apple at about $162 per share, about 17% below the market price. See our analysis of Apple Valuation for more details on what’s driving our price estimate for Apple and how it compares with peers.

However, many other traders have learned how to “follow the flow.” In other words, they want to know what the big funds and institutions are doing. When these buyers make their move in the options world, they leave a trail behind them -- footsteps in the data. We can follow those footsteps when looking for unusual options activity. Our guide is Fintel’s leaderboard of options activity, showing the action in both calls and puts, helping us keep track of it all when we see outsized volume. Let’s look at some of the most interesting action of the past week. Disney (DIS) Coming in at Number 1 on our Options Flow Leaderboard is Disney (US:DIS), which is interesting given that the stock continues to dip to 52-week lows. While $87.01 was the prior 52-week low from May, DIS stock has now closed below that mark in seven of the last nine sessions. That’s as shares are down about 57.5% from the all-time high, which was made in November 2021. Despite the clearly bearish price action, options investors seem torn on the stock’s trajectory. On July 27, there were two notable put trades that went through on the long side -- indicating a bearish position. That’s as someone bought $35.77 million of the January 2024 $160 puts and $3.69 million of the September $110 puts. There was also a $3.44 million sale of the January 2024 $120 puts tied to the same trade. All of these puts were deep-in-the-money as shares were trading near $85.50 at the time of the trade. The January 2024 $160 put was active on July 26, too. That’s as someone paid $37.14 million in premium for this particular put option, but then about 15 minutes later, another trade hit the tape. This time a $108.48 million sale of the January 2024 $160 puts. It coincided with a $10.68 million sale of the September $110 puts (the same strike traded that was pointed out above). Later, another $38.86 million of the January $160 puts were sold, so the trader in this name was quite large and quite active. Apple (AAPL) As the biggest stock in the world is gearing up to report earnings on Aug. 3, it’s not surprising to see Apple (US:AAPL) on our list at Number 2. Given that it’s Apple, there were plenty of low-seven-figure options trades placed over the last few days. However, two trades really stand out. The first came on July 24, as someone bought $38.9 million of the January $175 calls in three separate trades each about five minutes apart. These calls were in-the-money by almost $20 a share at the time of the trade. The second trade on AAPL stock options was a much deeper in-the-money position. That’s as someone bought $4.53 million of the June 2024 $110 calls on July 28. A few minutes later, they bought another $4.53 million worth of the same calls. Lucid Motors (LCID) Lucid Motors (US:LCID) lit up the options leaderboard during the week ending July 21 and traders were back at it last week, too. There was plenty of options flow that stood out — like when one trader scooped up $426,700 worth of the September $8 calls. However, one trade in particular really stood out. That trade came on July 26, the same day as the trade noted above, but this one was significantly larger. That’s as one trader sold $5.57 million worth of the January 2024 $47 puts and $5.22 million worth of the $37 puts of the same expiration. Notably, these LCID stock options were deep-in-the-money, with shares trading near $7.10 at the time of the trade. Perhaps it was investors&#039; way of speculating on electric vehicle stocks, as XPeng (US:XPEV) has caught fire this week… Xpeng (XPEV) Speaking of XPeng, the stock has been downright explosive. There are two factors in play here. First, Chinese EV stocks started the week with a bang on news of Chinese stimulus being put to work to help give the economy a boost. Second, Volkswagen took a stake in XPeng with a $700 million investment on Wednesday. Shares are up 60.5% this week alone, as XPEV stock works on its fourth weekly rally in the last five weeks. In that span, shares are up 130%. Interestingly, there were not a lot of trades that stood out specifically. However, one option was red hot, that being the $16 calls that expire on August 11th. Shortly after the session open, someone bought over $935,000 of these calls. Then, 10 minutes later, they bought another $960,000 of these calls. For what it’s worth, the August $20 calls were also quite active on the long side. Snap (SNAP) Snap (US:SNAP) reported earnings earlier this week, falling 14.2% on July 26 as a result. There was some pretty bullish flow going into the report, perhaps most notably the $7.7 million one trader spent on the August $14 calls. The calls were slightly out-of-the-money, with shares trading near $12.60 at the time. Obviously with the stock’s post-earnings decline though, these calls have been crushed. On the flip side, less than an hour before the close on July 25 -- so just before the company reported earnings -- someone sold $1.11 million of the August $13.50 calls. Nvidia (NVDA) Given the rise of AI stocks and semiconductor stocks, Nvidia (US:NVDA) has been at the forefront of the market surge. Despite NVDA stock trading pretty well this week -- up in four out of five trading days this week -- the bear flow was evident. There was quite a bit of low-seven-figure call sales, which is neutral at best but tends to lean bearish. Two directional trades that stood out were clear. That’s as one trader bought $6.53 million of the June 2025 at-the-money $440 calls on July 24, which expire in almost two years. The other came a day later on a $4.53 million purchase of the September at-the-money $460 puts. One other trade stood out, which came on July 26 as someone sold $24.97 million of the July 28 $510 puts and bought $24.94 million of the July 29 $505 puts. In other words, they sold the $510/$505 put spread, which was deep-in-the-money by about $50 a share and expired in just two days. This story originally appeared on Fintel.

Apple has acknowledged the bug, but it doesn&#039;t seem to have a solution or fix in hand just yet.What Happened: Apple&#039;s Family Sharing system, which allows users to set parental controls, has a bug.

This week’s list includes Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Starbucks SBUX, and Uber UBER. Green Shoots Emerging from the Earnings Landscape With a little over half of June-quarter results already out, we can confidently call the overall earnings picture reassuringly stable and resilient. Earnings aren&#039;t great, but no one expected them to be so. Instead, many in the market feared a material deterioration in the outlook that would show up in negative guidance and lowered estimates. While we have seen a few reports with downbeat guidance, the overall tone and substance of guidance and management commentary have been favorable. The net effect of this is a very stable earnings outlook, even though estimates in the aggregate are still coming down due to a weakening revisions trend for the Energy sector. You can see this by comparing earnings estimates for 2023 Q3 as well as full-year 2023 today to where they stood at the start of July and April. The expectation today is for 2023 Q3 earnings to be down -2.1% from the same period last year on +0.2% higher revenues. If we exclude the Energy sector, Q3 earnings would be up +3.3% on +3% higher revenues. One month ago, on June 27th, the expectation was for Q3 earnings to be down -1.4% on +0.7% higher revenues. Q3 earnings were expected to be up +3.4% on an ex-Energy basis on June 27th. Four months back, on March 29th, the expectation was for Q3 earnings to be up +0.6% on +0.7% higher revenues. Q3 earnings were expected to be up +4.4% on an ex-Energy basis on March 29th. This discussion of evolving aggregate Q3 earnings estimates reflects that while analysts have cut their estimates for the period, a big part of the negative revisions is due to the Energy sector. While estimates in the aggregate for the remaining 15 sectors of the S&amp;P 500 index are essentially unchanged over the past month, there are plenty of cross-currents at the individual sector levels. Specifically, estimates for the Tech, Construction, Autos, Transportation, and Utilities sectors have increased while the same for the other sectors have modestly come down. Regular readers of our earnings commentary would be familiar with these revisions trends, as we have been flagging them since the start of 2023 Q2. We noticed a significant stabilization in the revisions trend since the beginning of April, which was in contrast to the persistently negative revisions trend that had been in place for about a year prior. Q2 is on track to be the third consecutive quarter of earnings declines and the first quarter of declining revenues. As noted earlier, a big part of the earnings and revenue weakness is due to the Energy sector. Excluding the Energy sector drag, Q2 earnings would be down -2.9% on +3.6% higher revenues. 2023 Q2 will be the 6th consecutive quarter of declining margins for the S&amp;P 500 index. Margins in Q2 are expected to be below the year-earlier level for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest margin pressure expected to be in the Energy, Medical, Basic Materials, and Construction sectors. With the earnings focus lately on the Tech sector, it is instructive to see how much distance has been covered on the margins front in this vital sector. On the positive side, margins are on track to be above the year-earlier level for six sectors, with notable gains in the Consumer Discretionary, Finance, and Transportation sectors. As noted earlier, the estimate revisions trend has notably stabilized since the start of Q2. In the aggregate, S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates for 2023 have declined -1.6% since the beginning of April but only -0.5% on an ex-Energy basis. Importantly, estimates for sectors like Tech, Construction, Autos, and Transportation have increased in that timeframe. We see this favorable turn in the revisions trend as green shoots in the overall earnings landscape and indicative of better days ahead. Q2 Earnings Scorecard As of Friday, July 28th, the Q2 earnings season crossed the halfway mark, with results from 254 S&amp;P 500 members already out. We have a full reporting docket this upcoming week, with more than 1100 companies reporting results, including 169 S&amp;P 500 members. By the end of this week, we will have seen Q2 results from almost 85% of the index members. The notable companies reporting this week include Apple, Amazon, Starbucks, Uber and others. Apple&#039;s Q2 earnings are expected to be -4.1% below the year-earlier level on -2% lower revenues. The stock has been a standout performer this year, up +50.1% vs. +19.4% for the S&amp;P 500 index. It has been a while since Apple shares were down following a quarterly release. In fact, the last time the stock reacted negatively to a quarterly release was two years ago, in July 2021. Uber, which reports before the market&#039;s open on Tuesday, August 1st, has done even better than Apple this year, up +95.6% in the year-to-date period. This is expected to be a milestone quarter for Uber, with the current consensus EPS estimate at breakeven, up from the year-earlier period&#039;s -$1.33 loss. Total Q2 earnings for the 254 S&amp;P 500 members are down -3.4% from the same period last year on +1.7% higher revenues, with 80.3% beating EPS estimates and 64.6% beating revenue estimates. The Apple release after the market&#039;s close on Thursday, August 3rd, will keep the Tech sector in focus this week as well. Through Friday, July 28th, we have seen Q2 results from 52% of the sector&#039;s total market capitalization in the index. Total earnings for these Tech companies are up +0.4% from the same period last year on +1.5% higher revenues, with 93.8% beating EPS estimates and 75% beating revenue estimates.

Top Analyst Says 2 Factors Key To Meeting June-Quarter Expectations\n内容: Apple, Inc. AAPL is scheduled to report its fiscal-year third quarter on Thursday after the market closes.Analysts, on average, expect the company to report earnings per share of $1.08 on revenue of $74 billion. This will mark a decline from the year-ago EPS of $1.20 and revenue of $82.96 billion.An Apple bull is confident that the company will at least hit Street expectations.In-Line Q3 Guaranteed: iPhone units will likely show an upside relative to expectations in the June quarter, going by a clear uptick in demand around the key China region, said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives.Higher average selling price and overall upgrade activity on the iPhone 14 Pro may have helped the company override the choppy macro environment, he said.The analyst noted that ASPs were trending toward $900/$925 for the iPhones. “It&#039;s unique that this late the iPhone cycle, with iPhone 15 around the corner this fall, Apple is seeing such strong iPhone 14 demand,” he said.Ives also said that the App Store uptick will likely keep Services revenue on the upswing into the fiscal year 2024. These two combined should translate into headline numbers that will likely help Apple to at least meet Street expectations, he added.See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Apple StockFocus Items: Ives said the Street will remain laser-focused on CEO Tim Cook&#039;s comments on consumer demand globally and what they mean for the path forward. “We would expect relatively conservative September guidance as this is all about the drumroll to the main event with the anniversary iPhone 15 launch slated for the mid-September timeframe,” he said.Services Acceleration: Ives sees Apple&#039;s acceleration in Services business growth over the coming quarters to a double trajectory. The expectation is premised on another 100 million+ new iPhone users added to the Apple ecosystem over the past 18 months, improving attach rates and price increases.Increasing overall cloud storage plans, according to the analyst, also remains an upward trend for Apple’s Services business. Additionally, the overall FX headwinds have abated a bit, creating easier year-over-year comparisons into fiscal year 2024, he said.“We believe overall the Services business is worth $1.3 trillion to $1.4 trillion for Apple’s sum-of-the-parts valuation and remains an underappreciated asset by the Street with many naysayers still not believers in the “new Apple valuation” reset in motion,” Ives said.Ives has an Outperform rating and a $220 price target for Apple shares.Apple shares rose 1.35% to $195.83 on Friday, according to Benzinga Pro data.Read Next:\n\n---\n\n[2023-07-31] 2023-07-31 10:37:00\n标题: Apple Grapples With Weak Smartphone Market. These Analysts Say Buy the Stock Anyway.\n内容: Apple is expected to launch the successor to the iPhone 14 in September. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Getty Images Apple’s third-quarter report on Thursday is set to be the highlight of a busy earnings week. Optimism could be dented if the tech giant warns about a tough smartphone market when it updates on outlook, but analysts at Piper Sandler and Wedbush recommend investors look past that and back the stock to go higher. Apple (ticker: APPL) is dealing with a slowdown in smartphone sales along with the rest of the sector. Consensus forecasts are for Apple to generate $40.23 billion in revenue from iPhone sales in the June quarter, falling from $51.33 billion in the preceding quarter. Analysts at Piper Sandler wrote in a research note on Monday that they expect Apple to deliver on expectations for the June quarter and, more importantly, offer a September quarter forecast that will match or slightly exceed Wall Street consensus expectations. “In our conversations, most investors feel that a soft China could pose a risk to the numbers and further commentary, but we feel that Apple’s position in China is on a solid footing and that the company is likely to see only a small if any decline in its iPhone sales,” wrote Piper Sandler’s Harsh Kumar. Kumar pushed his target price on Apple up to $220 from $180, reiterating an Overweight rating on the stock. Apple shares were up 0.2% in premarket trading at $196.16, having risen 51% this year so far as of last Friday’s close. Wedbush’s Daniel Ives also said forecasts for a significant downturn in iPhone sales could prove to be unduly pessimistic. “We believe Apple should post at least in-line June quarter iPhone revenue with upside likely when the company reports this Thursday after the bell,” Ives wrote. Ives said the potential upside surprise could come from gaining market share in China, while holding steady in the U.S. and Europe. However, he warns that Apple could give a muted outlook for the current quarter. “We would expect relatively conservative September guidance as this is all about the drumroll to the main event with the anniversary iPhone 15 launch slated for the mid September time frame,” Ives wrote. Overall though, Ives suggests backing the $3 trillion stock on a likely acceleration in services revenue in 2024. Based on adding another 100 million iPhone users in the past 18 months, plus price increases and improving activity on the App Store, he expects the services business to accelerate to double-digit growth in the coming quarters. “We believe the Services business is worth $1.3 trillion to $1.4 trillion for Apple’s sum-of-the parts valuation and remains an underappreciated asset by the Street with many naysayers still not believers in the “new Apple valuation” reset in motion,” Ives wrote. Ives kept a Buy rating and $220 target price on Apple stock.

One of the questions posed in the letter asks whether Apple has plans to develop apps utilizing blockchain or related technologies, indicating a keen interest in understanding Apple’s approach to emerging tech and whether they are open to exploring these avenues within their ecosystem. NFTs are unique digital assets that are stored on blockchain networks, such as Ethereum ETH/USD and Polygon MATIC/USD.

Before a company reports earnings, implied volatility is usually high because the market is unsure about the outcome of the report. Speculators and hedgers create huge demand for the company’s options which increases the implied volatility, and therefore, the price of options. After the earnings announcement, implied volatility usually drops back down to normal levels. Let’s take a look at the expected range for these stocks. To calculate the expected range, look up the option chain and add together the price of the at-the-money put option and the at-the-money call option. Use the first expiry date after the earnings date. While this approach is not as accurate as a detailed calculation, it does serve as a reasonably accurate estimate. Monday SOFI – 16.2% ANET – 8.3% Tuesday AMD – 7.8% PFE – 3.7% SBUX – 5.4% CAT – 4.4% MRK – 3.1% NCLH – 8.4% UBER – 8.4% DVN – 5.1% Wednesday CVS – 4.3% PYPL – 8.2% HUM – 4.9% SHOP – 10.6% OXY – 4.3% KHC – 3.0% HOOD – 10.4% ETSY – 11.3% Thursday AMZN – 6.6% AAPL – 3.5% BUD – 5.6% COIN – 11.9% SQ – 8.4% ABNB – 7.8% DKNG – 11.0% EXPE – 7.6% NET – 13.3% Friday NKLA – 28.0% ENB – 4.1% D – 4.3% Option traders can use these expected moves to structure trades. Bearish traders can look at selling bear call spreads outside the expected range. Bullish traders can sell bull put spreads outside the expected range, or look at naked puts for those with a higher risk tolerance. Neutral traders can look at iron condors. When trading iron condors over earnings, it is best to keep the short strikes outside the expected range. When trading options over earnings, it is best to stick to risk defined strategies and keep position size small. If the stock makes a larger than expected move and the trade suffers a full loss, it should not have more than a 1-3% effect on your portfolio.

All three main U.S. indexes ended last week higher as signs of cooling inflation and a resilient economy cemented investor bets on a soft landing for the country. Upbeat quarterly earnings from megacap growth companies such as Alphabet GOOGL.O, Meta Platforms META.O as well as chipmakers Intel INTC.O and Lam Research LRCX.O have also boosted investor sentiment. Second-quarter earnings for S&amp;P 500 companies are now estimated to have fallen 6.4% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv data. While still negative, the forecast is an improvement from the 7.9% drop estimated a week ago. The blue-chip Dow .DJI logged its longest winning streak in nearly four-decades this month, underpinned by gains in sectors including healthcare, financials and energy that had underperformed during the first half of the year. \"Markets are growing increasingly confident that we are approaching the end of the current rate-hike cycle and that a soft landing can be delivered,\" said Joshua Warner, market analyst at City Index. \"However, the future path of interest rates and the outlook for earnings both remain at the behest of macroeconomic conditions and data will remain key.\" Investors will parse remarks by Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, due later in the day. Citigroup raised its 2023-end and mid-2024 S&amp;P 500 targets to 4,600 and 5,000, respectively, to reflect a higher possibility of a soft landing. The benchmark index closed at 4,582 on Friday. Investors await quarterly reports from Apple AAPL.O, Amazon.com AMZN.O and AMD AMD.O later this week, while July ISM Manufacturing reading and three sets of employment data, including July&#039;s non-farm payrolls are also in focus. At 07:00 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were up 44 points, or 0.12%, S&amp;P 500 e-minis EScv1 were up 4.5 points, or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were up 2.5 points, or 0.02%.

However, the landscape changed in 2022 with soaring inflation forcing the Federal Reserve to push up interest rates, which in turn increased the cost of capital. In response to this tough macro environment, investors are now increasingly prioritizing return-on-capital metrics and are shifting to Warren Buffett&#039;s time-tested investment strategy of buying high-quality stocks at an attractive price (value investing). Class A and B shares of Buffett&#039;s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway have gained 24.1% and 22.3%, respectively, in the past year. This is significantly more than the 15% rise recorded by the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index in the same time frame. Given this backdrop, let&#039;s assess whether Buffett&#039;s top two investments can prove to be good picks now. Apple Tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) accounts for 46.7% of Berkshire Hathaway&#039;s investment portfolio. This is not surprising considering Buffett and the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Charlie Munger, have a penchant for picking up stocks with a strong management and competitive advantage. Apple has managed to cultivate impressive customer loyalty and brand authority for its products (iPhone, iPad, and Mac). That&#039;s despite the ongoing contraction in the global smartphone market (which has lasted for two years. According to Counterpoint Research, Apple&#039;s iPhone ended the second quarter with a 17% share. Shipments of the iPhone have proven quite resilient, dropping by only 2% on a year-over-year basis, far lower than the 8% year-over-year drop in global smartphone shipments in the second quarter (due to a longer consumer replacement cycle and increasing demand for refurbished phones). While smartphone demand in lower and mid-tier segments has suffered, the premium segment has continued to grow. With iPhone firmly placed in the premium segment (smartphones costing $600 or more at wholesale), Apple has remained relatively immune to the headwinds in the broader smartphone market. Besides launching several generations of the iPhone, Apple has been committed to innovation in other products such as the iPad, Apple Watch, and MacBook. To further leverage its installed base of over 2 billion active devices, the company has also introduced a range of services such as iCloud storage, Apple Pay, Apple Music, Apple TV+, and the App Store. While these services do not bring high upfront payments (like devices do), they are helping the company build secure and recurring revenue streams with higher margins. This, in turn, is expected to make Apple less vulnerable to consumer slowdowns, while also increasing its bottom line. As per a Bloomberg report, Apple is also said to be making artificial intelligence tools to compete with OpenAI and Microsoft&#039;s ChatGPT, Alphabet&#039;s Google, and several others. In case these tools materialize, they will further contribute to the company&#039;s top line. The recent run-up in prices has made Apple&#039;s shares pretty expensive. The stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 33, significantly higher than the hardware industry median of 20.6. However, considering the company&#039;s solid long-term growth prospects, its share prices can continue to grow in the coming months. Hence, it makes sense for retail investors to pick up a small position in this stock even at current elevated levels. Bank of America The second-largest bank in the U.S. (by total assets), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) accounts for 8.7% of Berkshire Hathaway&#039;s investment portfolio. Despite the regional banking crisis, this Charlotte-based bank managed to surpass both consensus revenue and earnings estimates in the second quarter. In fact, CEO Brian Moynihan considers the second quarter to be one of the strongest quarters in the company&#039;s history. Bank of America reported an $18 billion drop in average deposits since the first quarter. While this may seem daunting, Bank of America&#039;s stellar balance sheet has helped build confidence among investors. The bank&#039;s common equity Tier 1 ratio (a risk-adjusted measure of financial strength) improved by 110 basis points year over year to 11.6%. The bank also has ample liquidity, as is evident from $867 billion in global liquidity sources. Thanks to the soaring inflation and subsequent interest rate hikes, Bank of America has seen impressive growth in net interest income (NII). With the Federal Reserve continuing its interest rate hike in July 2023, Bank of America may see even further growth in NII in the coming quarters. The bank also has managed to maintain the credit quality of its consumer and commercial portfolios despite the tough environment -- as is evident from the nearly stable and low percentage of nonperforming loans and leases in the second quarter. Bank of America has been long known for its solid dividend yield -- currently 2.96%. With that, plus its interest rate-sensitive business model, this banking giant may prove to be an attractive pick in the current macroeconomic environment. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The tech giant is the largest holding of Warren Buffett&#039;s Berkshire Hathaway, (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) accounting for a whopping 47% of its stock holdings at last count. Here are some of the factors that make Apple stock a compelling buy and hold right now. Strong financial performance Apple&#039;s financial performance has been impressive in recent quarters, despite the headwinds of high interest rates, unfavorable foreign exchange rates, supply chain disruptions, a slowing global economy, and geopolitical uncertainty. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, for example, Apple reported revenue of $94.8 billion. This figure does mark a 3% decrease from the same quarter a year ago, but Apple still returned a staggering $23 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends in the quarter. A business that can return that much cash to shareholders in a difficult operating environment is a model of success. Apple is also poised to benefit from the recovery of the global economy in 2024. Wall Street analysts project that the tech behemoth will grow its revenue by 6.7% in 2024. Mid-single-digit revenue growth is a remarkable achievement for a company with market value of over $3 trillion as of this writing. A loyal customer base One of the key advantages Apple has over its competitors is its extremely loyal customer base. According to a survey by SellCell, a platform for selling used phones and tablets, 92% of iPhone owners plan to stick with Apple the next time they upgrade their devices. This figure is notably higher than the loyalty rates for competitors such as Samsung (85.7%) and Alphabet (84%). Apple&#039;s loyal customers are willing not only to buy its hardware products but also its lineup of popular services, including Apple Pay and iTunes. That&#039;s great news, because Apple crossed the 2 billion active device user threshold last December. It thus has a huge customer base to leverage for its family of value-added services. Moreover, Apple&#039;s customer loyalty is likely to increase further with the introduction of new features and products that enhance its ecosystem. For instance, Apple recently launched the Vision Pro mixed-reality headset. While the Vision Pro is unlikely to be a major revenue driver because of its hefty price point, cutting-edge innovations like this one are likely to attract even more customers and subsequently bolster retention rates even further. A reasonable valuation and reliable dividend Despite its strong performance and growth prospects, Apple&#039;s stock is not overly expensive compared to its peers. At present, Apple&#039;s stock is trading at 29.6 times projected earnings. For comparison, Microsoft shares trade at over 30 times projected earnings, and Amazon shares exchange hands at over 82 times forward earnings. Apple&#039;s shares, in turn, are reasonably valued for a high-growth tech company. What&#039;s more, Apple stock offers a modest annualized dividend yield of 0.5% at current levels. While its dividend yield is below average for a large-cap company, its dividend is exceptionally well covered by earnings. Underscoring this point, Apple&#039;s trailing-12-month payout ratio of 15.5% is near rock bottom for a megacap company. Most of its peers, after all, sport payout ratios that consistently fall between 40% and 60%. Bottom line: The company should have no problem raising its dividend for the 12th consecutive year in the next fiscal period. The big picture Buffett is a big fan of Apple for a host of reasons. It has stellar financials, a loyal customer base, a reasonable valuation, and a well-supported dividend program. So if you&#039;re looking for a stock that can deliver long-term value and income, you might want to follow Buffett&#039;s lead and buy Apple hand over fist right now. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

For the second quarter of 2023, NCR projects revenues between $1.9 billion and $2 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.95 billion, suggesting a 2.3% increase from the year-ago period. The company forecasts a non-GAAP EPS in the band of 70-76 cents for the to-be-reported quarter. The consensus mark for earnings stands at 63 cents per share, 11.3% lower than the year-ago quarter. In the last reported quarter, NCR delivered outstanding results, with strong revenue growth and increased profitability despite the challenging macroeconomic environment. The enterprise technology provider’s first-quarter non-GAAP earnings jumped 6% year over year to 56 cents per share and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents. Revenues increased 1% year over year to $1.89 billion and beat the consensus mark of $1.84 billion. Let’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement. NCR Corporation Price and EPS Surprise NCR Corporation price-eps-surprise | NCR Corporation Quote Key Factors to Consider NCR’s second-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the strong demand for its software and service solutions across the banking, retail and hospitality industries. The rapid adoption of digital banking solutions is driving its Banking segment revenues. The company received positive feedback from customers on the new features and the functionality of its digital banking solutions. Our estimate for the Digital Banking division’s revenues is currently pegged at $134.6 million, suggesting year-over-year growth of 2.8%. In light of the pandemic and efforts to lower costs, hospitality-related businesses and food, restaurant, convenience, drug and fuel retail chain operators globally have been seeking technology to automate their processes. This has been driving the demand for NCR’s store and work operation automation-related software and service solutions. In the last reported quarter, revenues from the Retail segment grew 1.1% year over year, while the Hospitality division’s sales soared 5.7%. The trend is likely to have continued in the second quarter. However, a negative impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates is likely to have more than offset the benefits of the aforementioned factors for the Retail and Hospitality segments’ performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate for the Retail division’s revenues is currently pegged at $561.1 million, indicating a year-over-year decline of 0.2%. Our estimate for the Hospitality business unit suggests revenues to decline approximately 2.4% year over year and reach $232.4 million. NCR’s acquisition of Cardtronics last year is anticipated to have driven the acceleration of the NCR-as-a-service strategy. Cardtronics’ robust debit network expanded NCR’s payments platform and helped it connect with retail and bank customers, thereby facilitating customer acquisition. However, a strong U.S. dollar is likely to have more than offset the benefits. Our estimate for the Self-Service Banking segment is pegged at $649.6 million, indicating a year-over-year decline of 4.3%. Additionally, NCR’s overall second-quarter performance is likely to have been negatively impacted by softening IT spending as organizations are pushing back their investments in big and expensive technology products due to global economic slowdown concerns. Furthermore, the strong U.S. dollar, increased interest expenses and a higher tax rate are likely to have more than offset the benefits of last year’s pricing and cost actions. This is anticipated to have dragged the bottom line lower than the year-ago quarter. What Our Model Says Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for NCR this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here. Though NCR currently sports a Zacks Rank of #1, it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Stocks With the Favorable Combination Per our model, NVIDIA NVDA, Apple AAPL and Alibaba BABA have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases. NVIDIA is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Aug 23. The company sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an Earnings ESP of +5.56% at present. NVDA’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the trailing four quarters while missing the same on two occasions, the average surprise being 0.3%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.06 per share, suggesting a whopping increase of 303.9% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 51 cents. NVIDIA’s quarterly revenues are estimated to increase 64.4% year over year to $11.02 billion. Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.66%. The company is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Aug 3. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the preceding four quarters while missing the same on one occasion, with the average surprise being 2.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple’s third-quarter earnings stands at $1.19 per share, a penny lower than the year-ago quarter. It is estimated to report revenues of $81.26 billion, which suggests a decrease of approximately 2.1% from the year-ago quarter. Alibaba carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +6.19%. The company is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Aug 10. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 16.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BABA’s first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.90 per share, indicating a year-over-year increase of 8.6%. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $31.01 billion, suggesting a year-over-year rise of 1%. Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.

The stock has exhibited a bullish trend, rebounding strongly and surging by over 50% this year, demonstrating Apple&#039;s robust growth trajectory. Wall Street&#039;s ever-present uncertainty adds an element of suspense as the release of Q3 earnings, anticipated to be 1.08 EPS, becomes a key factor in assessing Apple&#039;s financial stability and its capacity for further growth. As Apple teeters on the precipice of its record high, the forthcoming days will reveal if the Q3 earnings will provide enough thrust to propel the stock beyond the elusive $200 threshold. Apple Inc&#039;s AAPL stock has been hovering close to the $200 mark, building anticipation for a potential breakthrough.While there has been a slight dip in the stock price, it has found stability just above the daily 20 simple moving average, which is acting as a reliable support level.The stock price has rebounded strongly and is moving upwards, displaying a clear bullish trend.This clear continuation pattern indicates positive momentum. In fact, the stock price has surged by more than 50% this year, demonstrating the tech giant&#039;s impressive growth.The potential for Apple&#039;s stock price to surpass the $200 mark appears promising following its significant growth this year. However, as is the nature of Wall Street, uncertainty lingers. The release of Q3 earnings on Thursday will be a crucial factor in assessing Apple&#039;s financial stability and potential for further growth.According to projections, the expected earnings per share (EPS) in Q3 will be 1.08, which shows a slight decline from the 1.20 EPS recorded in the same quarter of the previous year. It&#039;s important to mention that the earnings for Q2 2023 were 1.52, which is significantly higher than the anticipated earnings for Q3.Anticipation builds as Apple teeters on the verge of surpassing its record high of $198.23. The question remains: will Q3 earnings be enough to propel the stock price beyond this significant milestone?Will we witness the long-awaited breakthrough of the $200 threshold, or will it take additional time to gather the required momentum?The answers to these questions will become clear in the next few days. If the result is favorable, it&#039;s important to be ready for the possibility of new record highs being created.After the closing bell on Friday, July 28, the stock closed at $195.83, trading up by 1.29%.\n\n---\n\n[2023-08-01] 2023-07-31 17:23:10\n标题: Three Major Tech Firms Announcing Earnings This Week: What You Need To Know\n内容: Three major U.S. firms will announce their quarterly earnings this week, making it a pivotal time for the U.S. economy. As a barometer of the health and performance of the U.S. economy, investors will scrutinize these results, hoping to make more informed decisions based on the findings, which will provide light on consumer spending, company investments, and market movements. The trajectory of the stock market and investor mood may hinge on the findings of these results. AMD Q2 Earnings On Tuesday, financial results will be released by Advance Micro Devices (AMD). Even though NVIDIA has been stealing the spotlight in the AI space, traders are betting that the industry as a whole is so vast that no one company can hope to corner the market. As a result, investors will probably mostly focus on AI-related remarks. Experts predict that sales will total $5.33 billion, down 18.8 percent from the prior-year period. The markets are betting that the weak demand for gaming and other gadgets will improve by the end of the year and into 2024. Perhaps more worrisome is the fact that sales of datacenter chips (used in data centers) are expected to fall by 5.8 percent this quarter. Adjusted earnings per share are predicted to fall for the fourth consecutive quarter, this time by 45 percent to $0.57. However, when additional data from the same time period is made public, rising earnings are expected to continue in the second half. Amazon&#039;s Q2 Earnings A company whose revenue is highly correlated with economic activity is Amazon (AMZN). A turnaround in consumer confidence has coincided with rising hopes that the U.S. economy might avert a recession. However, the company&#039;s quarterly profits are based on statistics from a time when economic mood was very low, so the present rise in sentiment is unlikely to have an effect on the results we&#039;ll get this week. Amazon&#039;s Web Services metrics are the most important to investors since they account for the vast majority of the company&#039;s income. It is anticipated that revenues will rise by 10% over the prior year, coming in at around $21.7 billion. It will be the sixth straight quarter of reduced growth, and again, this will be attributed to the fact that economic activity is slowing, if the actual result matches or even comes a little softer than this. Traders, however, are optimistic that Amazon&#039;s presence in the AI field will help it mitigate the effects of a slower growth rate on its stock price. Keep in mind that investors shouldn&#039;t count on much of an uptick, and look to Microsoft&#039;s profits for guidance; the company has deep ties to the AI industry thanks to its holdings in ChatGPT, but the stock hardly budged on the back of all the AI hoopla. The stock price dropped unjustly as a result of the hysteria around the company&#039;s association with the AI. The pressure on Amazon&#039;s margins from increasing inflation will be another area of attention among traders when it releases its results, and this is despite the fact that inflation-related difficulties have begun to lighten somewhat. The second quarter is forecast to see a 41.5% increase in operational profit, reaching $4.7 billion. The stock is selling at a significant discount to its all-time high from 2021, and there is a lot of possibility for growth given the company&#039;s participation in AI and the improvement in economic optimism. Q2 Results for Apple So far this year, Apple&#039;s (AAPL) profits have failed to excite Wall Street, but the stock price has generated significant interest from buyers. The new record high value brought the total assets of the corporation to $3 trillion. Overall, investors have low expectations for its quarterly results, and they anticipate a further slowdown in sales projection for the following quarter with relatively flat earnings. Revenues are expected to decrease by 1.8% from previous year, totaling $81.5 billion. Due to the economic recession, the decline in hardware demand is expected to be the most prominent story. The company&#039;s income is heavily dependent on iPhone sales, and analysts predict that those figures will continue to drop, potentially by 2.2%, to $38.8 billion. Consistent growth in Apple&#039;s service offerings like AppleCare, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and the App Store should contribute to a 5.8% increase in revenue, bringing total Apple revenue to $20.7 billion. The projected increase in adjusted earnings per share from the prior year to $1.20 would be the slowest of any of the major technology companies. Despite widespread pessimism, investors who wait until the price drops on the basis of bad earnings data may be rewarded if Apple announces a new iPhone in September. Apple also has a vested interest in maintaining its stock price; in the past, when earnings have been disappointing, the firm has responded by announcing share buybacks. Traders will pay great attention to the conference call and will search for the term \"AI\" throughout it. Apple hasn&#039;t used this word to increase profits yet, but there have been several rumors that the business will utilize its considerable influence to establish a presence in that industry. We&#039;ll look to see if we get any confirmation of that during their earnings report.

More importantly, he estimates that Apple will deliver September assumptions that will match or slightly exceed street expectations primarily driven by strength in India for iPhone sales offset by general macro weakness in China. For June, the analyst expects Apple to slightly miss street EPS expectations of $1.19 by between $0.02 to $0.04 and deliver revenue marginally lower than the street&#039;s $81.7 billion for the quarter. Kumar expects dynamics around potential soft conditions in China to reflect in the September quarter guide. The Indian market, on the other hand, offers upside and potentially offsets any headwinds from China. The analyst writes that Apple&#039;s iPhone sales in China will meet internal expectations. Still, he is concerned about other products from Apple, such as watches, AirPods, and Macs, about their sales within China, given the weak macroeconomic outlook for both June and September. Over the last three quarters, he believes iPhone share within China has shown positive momentum. Just in 1Q23, for example, while the Chinese handset market declined by ~5%, Apple&#039;s share grew roughly 6%. In other words, the concerns about China&#039;s slow-down for iPhone might be relatively, if not wholly, overblown. Kumar estimates that Apple gets roughly 10% of its sales from phones in China. Assuming the Chinese market declines in the mid-single digits and Apple keeps up with that pace (worst case scenario), the impact will only amount to 0.5% of Apple&#039;s iPhone sales within the quarter. By comparison, India is serving as a rapidly emerging market for Apple following the momentum from the first two brick-and-mortar stores recently opened in the country. Per counterpoint, India is likely to account for roughly 4% of iPhone sales for Apple within the upcoming June 2023 quarter, with reportedly a 50% Y/Y jump. Apple will likely reach a goal of 5% share within India this year, up from roughly 2% last year, as the iPhone becomes the dominant handset in the high-end segment of the market. Overall, Apple is holding up much better in the Chinese end market and might be able to offset meaningful declines, if any. While India is likely to contribute positively and more than offset any declines that Apple might see in the Chinese market. The higher price target and multiple reflects his increased optimism for AAPL&#039;s execution in the back half of the year. Price Action: AAPL shares traded higher by 0.22% at $196.23 on the last check Monday.\n\n---\n\n[2023-08-01] 2023-07-31 19:49:00\n标题: Apple supplier Foxconn plans $500 mln component factories in India - Bloomberg News\n内容: Adds investment details in paragraphs 2 and 3 July 31 (Reuters) - Apple&#039;s AAPL.O main supplier, Foxconn Technology Group 2317.TW, is planning to invest close to $500 million to build two component factories in India, Bloomberg News reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter. These factories will be built in the southern state of Karnataka and at least one of them will produce Apple parts, including for iPhones, the report said. The exact locations of the new plants in the state are yet to be decided and a formal announcement is expected as early as this week. Foxconn and Apple did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. Karnataka has already approved investment to the tune of 80 billion rupees ($972.88 million) by a Foxconn unit in March, making it the third southern Indian state after Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu to allow Foxconn plants. As part of its investment drive in India in its bid to diversify beyond China, the Taiwanese company has also signed a deal with Tamil Nadu to invest 16 billion rupees in a new electronic components manufacturing facility that will create 6,000 jobs, the state government said on Monday. The Foxconn Industrial Internet 601138.SS facility will be built in the Kancheepuram district near the state capital of Chennai, a state government source said on condition of anonymity as details are not yet public.

Following the end of trading on Thursday (Aug 3), Apple (NASADQ:AAPL) will take its turn to announce its fiscal third quarter report. Going by recent Asia supply chain checks, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives expects Apple will post “at least in-line June quarter iPhone revenues with upside likely.” “We believe iPhone units based on a clear uptick in demand around the key China region this quarter could show some upside despite the choppy macro as higher ASPs and overall upgrade activity on iPhone Pro 14 carry the day for Cook &amp; Co,” the 5-star analyst expounded. What’s rather intriguing about the strong iPhone 14 demand, is that it is late in the iPhone cycle, given the iPhone 15 is expected to launch this fall. That is not the only piece of the Apple puzzle expected to put in a strong showing. Ives thinks Services revenue should “be on the upswing into FY24.” Combined, Apple should then deliver headline numbers that will “at least meet the Street’s expectations with the path higher for the stock with this new tech bull market now underway.” As for the September quarter, with the main event of the year being the anniversary iPhone 15 launch (slated for around mid-September), Ives is expecting a “relatively conservative” guide. With the handing over of the baton from one iPhone to another about to take place, Ives sees this handoff as being a “steadier transition than some other peak to valley iPhone cycles of the past.” Additionally, Ives is also encouraged by a “noteworthy trend” of rising ASPs (average selling prices) that are moving toward $900/$925 per iPhone. All told, looking forward to “another flex the muscles moment” from Apple, Ives maintains an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating on the shares, backed by a $220 price target. The implication for investors? Upside of 12% from current levels. (To watch Ives’ track record, click here) Most on the Street remain in Apple’s corner. The stock claims a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 24 Buys vs. 7 Holds. However, taking into account the big year-to-date gains (up by 57%), the $200.61 average target suggests the shares will remain rangebound for a while.

The situation became even more precarious due to the absence of cellular signals on the remote island, leaving them cut off from conventional communication methods.See Also: Forget Foldable iPhone, Apple Has Filed A Patent For A Rollable iPhoneFortunately, fate was on their side, as both were equipped with the latest iPhone 14 models, featuring the groundbreaking SOS via Satellite capability, reported SooToday, citing a video and photographs shared by Eric Belanger. “We were able to get assistance from the MNR by using the new GlobalStar emergency feature of the iPhone 14 while pulling up to the burning island,” said Belanger. Why It’s Important: The Emergency SOS via satellite feature is available on iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. It allows users to send SOS to emergency services without cellular and WiFi coverage. In December last year, the feature proved its life-saving potential when it helped rescue a stranded man in remote Alaska. The man activated the feature during a snowmobile trip from Noorvik to Kotzebue, prompting a swift response from Alaska State Troopers and local search teams. The feature is also credited with helping a rescue team find two people stranded 300 feet in a remote canyon with zero cell service in the Angeles National Forest.Photo Courtesy: Shutterstock.comCheck out more of Benzinga’s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.Read Next:\n\n---\n\n[2023-08-01] 2023-08-01 06:31:33\n标题: How To Enable Crash Detection On iPhone And Apple Watch\n内容: Apple Inc.&#039;s AAPL iPhone 14 series includes a life-saving feature that has already helped multiple people escape terrifying accidents.

Why That May Not Happen.\n内容: A jubilant July typically heralds a sensational second half of the year. But history doesn’t always repeat itself. The S&amp;P 500 rose an impressive 3.1% last month. When the index has risen at least 2.5% in July, it averages a gain of 8.4% in the second half of the year, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Newsletter Sign-up But, if 2023 is going to conform to that trend, investors may well be wondering where those gains are going to come from. Now that recession fears have subsided (part of the reason for last month’s gains), investors have shifted their focus when it comes to economic data. They can’t be too bad as to damage the economy and bring back recession concerns, but they can’t be too good as to push the Federal Reserve into more rate hikes. The sweet spot is likely to be data that are slightly below expectations. The Fed signaling an end to its hiking cycle is another potential catalyst. The history-matching gains are unlikely to come from this earnings season—despite being robust, companies have not been rewarded for beating expectations. S&amp;P 500 companies reporting positive surprises have actually suffered an average 0.2% share price decline in the period that runs from two days before earnings to two days after, according to FactSet data. That’s below the five-year average of a 1% jump. The magnitude of earnings surprises is also below historical averages, and expectations are low—which may explain the muted reaction. If any company can buck that trend, it’s likely to be Apple—which reports results Thursday. But the tech giant’s 51% gains so far in 2023 mean it needs to produce something special. The broader stock market also needs something out of the ordinary and a bit of luck, to keep the momentum going. —Callum Keown *** Join Barron’s associate editor for technology Eric Savitz and Ben Reitzes, managing director and head of technology research of Melius Research, today at noon when they discuss the outlook for tech earnings, AI, and tech stocks.

This comes amid global oil prices rallying on optimism that recession fears have been overdone. BP’s underlying replacement cost profit—the company’s definition of net income—fell 69% to $2.6 billion, or 14.77 cents per share in the second quarter. Analysts were expecting net income of $3.4 billion, 19 cents per share. The British oil giant raised its dividend by 10% Tuesday and announced a new $1.5 billion share buyback program. The company’s earnings confirmed the industry trend of tumbling profits, compared with the same period last year when energy prices were soaring following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In recent earnings Exxon profit tumbled 55%, Shell dropped 56%, and Chevron declined 47%. “The BP share price, much like its peer Shell, has probably seen the highs of the year, given how far energy prices have fallen over the past 12 months,” CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson said early Tuesday. What’s Next: The strong run in global oil prices looks set to continue. The front-month nymex crude (WTI) is up 15.22% this month, according to Dow Jones market data. Statistically when oil rises at least 10% in the month of July there are average gains of 39.89% for oil over the second half of the year. —Callum Keown and *** SoFi Technologies Gets a Jolt from Personal Loans, Deposits shares soared to a new 52-week high after beating second-quarter expectations, as a bump in home-loan and personal loan volumes helped overcome uncertainty about the future of federal student loan repayments. Shares jumped more than 20%. SoFi reported a narrower-than-expected loss, saying deposits rose 26% and personal-loan origination volume grew 51%, while student-loan volume fell 1%. CEO Anthony Noto told Barron’s in July the company expects “ample” demand from borrowers trying to refinance their loans. The fintech company now expects 2023 adjusted net revenue of $1.97 billion to $2.03 billion, higher than its previous guidance. Management continues to see student loan refinancings remaining around current levels until September and then rise. The company doesn’t expect a return to prepandemic levels this year. The Biden administration continues to pursue other ways to provide relief on federal student loans. Borrowers can start enrolling in a new income-driven repayment plan, which lowers the monthly amount they would pay from discretionary income to 5% from 10%. Borrowers can apply at the Education Department website. The administration is offering a 12-month “on ramp” to repayment, from Oct. 1, 2023 to Sept. 30, 2024, during which missed payments won’t be marked delinquent, hurt credit reports or trigger debt-collection agencies. What’s Next: Resuming federal student loan repayments in October will subtract about $9 billion a month from consumer spending, or $100 billion a year, said Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Sl k. — *** Travel Stocks Gain Attention as Americans Take Time Off As Americans maintain their summer travel comeback after the Covid-19 pandemic, website traffic to major hotel websites ticked up more than 5% in May and early June, analytics firm SimilarWeb said. That’s a bullish sign for hotel stocks, according to Raymond James analyst William Crow. Crow’s favorite stocks include Hilton Worldwide Holdings, which has a pipeline of new growth, and Ryman Hospitality Properties, the locations of which in high-demand places such as Orlando and Denver are recording increased supply but few direct rivals in group travel. Crow warned that headwinds for hotels include higher operating and nonoperating costs (such as wages, property insurance, and property taxes), higher rates, slowing leisure demand, slow-to-recover business transient demand, and potential labor union issues. Oppenheimer analyst Jed Kelly raised his price targets on Expedia Group, and Booking Holdings, rating both travel booking stocks a buy-equivalent. He believes Expedia will benefit from “better hotel trends, operational improvements, and attractive valuation,” and Booking will “generate stable growth and margin expansion.” But he sidelined Airbnb stock for its higher valuation, and Tripadvisor because of increased competition for its Viator travel booking brand and the threat of artificial intelligence in trip planning. What’s Next: Unesco wants to add Venice to its list of World Heritage sites in danger from “irreversible” damage from climate change, mass tourism, and insufficient efforts by Italian officials to address ongoing issues. The recommendation could be adopted by UNESCO’s World Heritage Committee in Riyadh in September. —Teresa Rivas and Janet H. Cho *** Arista Networks Beats Expectations and Signals Growth Arista Networks shares traded sharply higher after the data-center-networking hardware provider posted second-quarter results that were better than analysts had feared. Shares rose 14% in late trading Monday. Arista shares fell last week on concerns about a potential slowdown in data center infrastructure demand, following disappointing results from rival Juniper Networks, and signs of moderating spending from Arista’s two biggest customers, Microsoft and Facebook’s Meta Platforms. For the June quarter, revenue rose 8% to $1.46 billion, ahead of Arista’s guidance, and Wall Street’s consensus estimate. Chief Financial Officer Ita Brennan said despite shorter lead times and reduced visibility, the company is executing well. It now sees revenue growth of more than 30% this year from last year. Database information provider ZoomInfo cut its September quarter guidance after second-quarter revenue rose 16% but came in slightly below expectations. It now sees September-quarter revenue of $309 million to $312 million, which is lower than Wall Street estimates. What’s Next: For the September quarter, Arista expects revenue of $1.45 billion to $1.5 billion, beating Wall Street expectations. Arista projects third-quarter adjusted gross margin of 62%, and adjusted operating margin of 41%. —Eric J. Savitz and Janet H. Cho *** There’s Another $1 Billion Lottery Jackpot Up for Grabs There’s yet another $1 billion multistate lottery jackpot up for grabs. The Mega Millions grand prize—actually estimated around $1.05 billion—is the fourth-largest in that lottery’s history. The drawing is at 11 p.m. Eastern time tonight. Lotteries have been getting bigger since 2016, when multistate lottery operators made shifts that lowered the odds and encouraged big jackpots. There have been seven claimed winning tickets of $1 billion or more since then. The person or group who won the $1.08 billion jackpot in a July Powerball lottery hasn’t come forward, perhaps because California, the place where the sole ticket with all the winning numbers hit, requires winners to identify themselves by their full names. New York has the same rule, but state lawmakers want a law to allow winners to remain anonymous. At least eight states already allow anonymity, including Delaware, Kansas, Maryland, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Wyoming. Eric Jaffe, a lawyer who has arranged LLCs for New York winners to shield their identities, said safety is an issue. “The risk is just too great.” It’s the second time this year that Mega Millions has grown to more than $1 billion. Powerball, also sold in 45 states and Washington, D.C., grew to more than $2 billion before a winning ticket was drawn last November. What’s Next: If a winning ticket is drawn tonight, there’s an option to take the 30-year annuity payout with an initial payment of roughly $15 million, or a lump sum, estimated at around $528 million. —Liz Moyer *** Uncredited Be sure to join this month’s Barron’s Daily virtual stock exchange challenge and .

Gen Digital was formerly known as NortonLifeLock Inc. and was trading under the NLOK ticker symbol. NortonLifeLock changed its name and ticker symbol, effective from Nov 8, 2022, following the completed merger of NortonLifeLock and Avast Plc. The newly named company unites trusted consumer safety brands, including Norton, Avast, LifeLock, AVG, Avira, CCleaner and ReputationDefender. The company projects quarterly revenues between $940 million and $950 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $947.2 million, indicating a 33.8% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $708 million. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Gen Digital expects non-GAAP earnings in the range of 45 cents-47 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 46 cents per share, a penny higher than the year-ago reported figure of 45 cents. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters while matching the same on one occasion, the average surprise being 5.3%. Let’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement. Gen Digital Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Gen Digital Inc. price-eps-surprise | Gen Digital Inc. Quote Factors to Note Gen Digital’s first-quarter top line is likely to have been primarily driven by the inclusion of the Avast business, which has significantly increased the combined company’s Average Direct Customer count. Our first-quarter estimate for this key metric is pegged at 37.8 million, which is close to 38.2 million at the end of the last reported quarter. Moreover, the expansion of product offerings following the merger of NortonLifeLock and Avast is likely to have facilitated the newly formed company to cross-sell products to each other’s customers, thereby aiding Average Revenue Per User (“ARPU”) growth. Gen Digital’s ARPU increases 15 cents sequentially to $7.24 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. We anticipate the trend is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. Our first-quarter fiscal 2024 estimate for ARPU is pegged at $7.31, which is 7 cents higher than the fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 level. GEN’s first-quarter performance is also likely to have benefited from the increased demand for cybersecurity and ID analytics solutions amid the hybrid work environment. Over the past couple of years, as more people are shifting online, the need for online privacy has been rising. Global workforces working remotely are logging into employers&#039; networks, escalating the need for digital security. This trend is likely to have spurred the demand for Gen Digital’s security products in the fiscal first quarter. Our first-quarter estimate for Gen Digital’s Consumer Security segment’s revenues is pegged at $572.7 million, indicating a year-over-year increase of 42.5%. Our estimate of $357.1 million for the Identity and Information Protection division implies growth of 21.5% from the year-ago quarter. An expansion in the EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin American regions is also likely to have been an upside for GEN this season. Further, the growing number of client bookings, supported by their retention and renewal rates, is anticipated to have contributed to the company’s fiscal first-quarter top line. At the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, Gen Digital’s client retention rate was 76%, while bookings grew 29% on a year-over-year basis. The Norton and Avast antivirus maker’s sustained focus on growing partner channels and employee benefit programs is likely to have driven its performance in the quarter to be reported. Our estimate for the company’s Partner revenues is pegged at $96.8 million, which calls for a 34.4% increase from the year-ago quarter. Additionally, Direct Customer revenues are expected to increase 33.5% year over year to $833 million, per our estimate. However, GEN’s overall first-quarter performance is likely to have been negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rates. In the last reported financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, foreign currency headwinds lowered revenues by $21 million. Additionally, increased interest expenses due to enhanced debt related to Avast acquisition financing are likely to have weighed on the bottom line. Moreover, the company’s earnings per share are expected to have been negatively impacted by the equity dilution impact of the Avast acquisition. To finance the acquisition of Avast, Gen Digital issued 94 million new shares. What Our Model Says Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Gen Digital this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here. Though GEN currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3, it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Stocks With the Favorable Combination Per our model, NVIDIA NVDA, Apple AAPL and Alibaba BABA have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases. NVIDIA is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Aug 23. The company sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an Earnings ESP of +5.56% at present.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.06 per share, suggesting a whopping increase of 303.9% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 51 cents. NVIDIA’s quarterly revenues are estimated to increase 64.4% year over year to $11.02 billion. Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.66%. The company is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Aug 3. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the preceding four quarters while missing the same on one occasion, with the average surprise being 2.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple’s third-quarter earnings stands at $1.19 per share, a penny lower than the year-ago quarter. It is estimated to report revenues of $81.26 billion, which suggests a decrease of approximately 2.1% from the year-ago quarter. Alibaba carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +6.19%. The company is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Aug 10. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 16.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BABA’s first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.90 per share, indicating a year-over-year increase of 8.6%.

Atlassian projects fiscal fourth-quarter revenues between $900 million and $920 million ($910 million at the midpoint). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $911.2 million, suggesting growth of 19.9% from the year-ago reported figure. For fourth-quarter earnings, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 43 cents per share, implying a 59.3% increase from 27 cents reported in the year-ago period. Atlassian surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters while missing the same on one occasion, the average surprise being 26.9%. Let’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement. Atlassian Corporation PLC Price and EPS Surprise Atlassian Corporation PLC price-eps-surprise | Atlassian Corporation PLC Quote Key Factors to Note The rising adoption of TEAM’s cloud-based solutions and the massive digitalization trend in organizations, along with the growing hybrid working trend, are likely to have favored the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter performance. The growing demand for Atlassian’s cloud products from new and existing clients using on-premises products might have acted as a tailwind. Our estimate for revenues from Cloud deployment is pegged at $554.3 million, indicating a 27.7% increase from the year-ago quarter. Revenues from Data Center deployment are anticipated to grow 38.1% year over year to $219.5 million. The increasing traction for core products like Jira Software and Confluence Cloud and the rising adoption of new products like Jira Service Management may have acted as key catalysts. An improvement in product quality and performance, multiple product launches and increased pricing are also likely to have boosted the firm’s performance. Atlassian’s latest focus on adding AI features to some of its collaboration software is likely to have driven the fourth-quarter top line. In April 2023, the company collaborated with OpenAI to enhance the capabilities of its Confluence, Jira Service Management and other programs with generative AI features. Robust growth in subscription revenues, aided by the solid uptake of the company’s subscription-based offerings, is likely to be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter’s results. Our estimate of $764.5 million for the Subscription segment’s revenues indicates massive 28% year-over-year growth. A large number of customers are opting for cloud offerings amid the ongoing cloud migration. Such new additions and increased pricing on certain products contributed to the company’s quarterly revenues. Our estimate suggests that TEAM is likely to have ended the fourth quarter with 266,330 customers, which will be a significant improvement of 9.8% year over year and 2.5% sequentially. Additionally, Atlassian’s sustained focus on cost savings is likely to have boosted the fourth-quarter bottom line. The company expects that its March 2023 announced restructuring actions, which include a reduction of lease-related expenses and total workforce by 5% or 500 employees, will benefit the fourth-quarter operating income by $20 million. What Our Model Says Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Atlassian this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.

The Chennai-based company, which distributes IT products of global giants like Apple AAPL.O and Dell Technologies DELL.N, said net profit dropped to 2.49 billion rupees ($30.3 million) for the quarter ended June 30, compared with 3.16 billion rupees a year earlier. Corporations globally are reeling from the impact of higher expenses, partly due to higher interest rates, while several firms including Redington are also investing heavily to digitize their businesses more. The company reported expenses climbing 27%, which ate into its bottomline. A pandemic-led demand for consumer electronics, including smartphones and personal computers, is fading as people are spending more time in physical schools and offices, denting demand for work- and learn-from-home equipment. Revenue from operations rose 26% to 211.87 billion rupees but dropped 3% sequentially. Revenue from its rest of the world unit, which makes up more than half of its topline and includes the Middle East, Turkey and Africa, dropped around 5% from the previous quarter even as it jumped 29% from a year earlier.

(NYSE: RCL): 119.64% Tesla: 116.30% PulteGroup Inc. (NYSE: PHM): 86.29% Align Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: ALGN): 81.08% Palo Alto Networks Inc. (NASDAQ: PANW): 78.04% Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NYSE: NCLH): 75.98% General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE): 74.95% That’s quite a different list from the one you would have seen a couple of months ago. In particular, as cruise lines sail to higher prices, the makeup of S&amp;P top performers is changing. Equal-Weighted S&amp;P As Gauge Of Breadth One informative way to slice and dice the performance of S&amp;P internals is by comparing the performance of the equal-weighted index with the traditional market-cap weighted. As its name implies, the S&amp;P 500 equal-weighted index assigns an equal weighting to each constituent, providing a balanced representation of all included stocks. That means no component, regardless of its market capitalization, has outsized influence over index performance. This approach tends to tilt the index toward the smaller holdings, which are frequently more volatile than the mega-caps that dominate the market-cap-weighted index. That volatility isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as it can, at times, lead to outperformance. You can track the S&amp;P equal-weighted index with the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight ETF (NYSEARCA: RSP). While the equal-weighted index can provide a more diversified representation of components, giving smaller companies an equal sway as larger ones and potentially reducing concentration risk, the traditional market-cap weighted index is still outperforming by a wide margin. Not Unusual To See Performance Divergence So far this year, the market-cap-weighted S&amp;P 500 is outpacing the equal-weighted index by 97%. It’s not necessarily unusual to see that disparity at this juncture; there’s generally a cyclical nature to the indexes’ returns, as the market-cap weighted tends to outperform as the market is rebounding, as is happening this year. Still, the performance of the equal-weight index offers one more data point to support the case that breadth is returning to markets. A look at the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight ETF’s chart shows the fund is within a whisker of clearing a base that began in early February. So what does the performance of equal-weighted S&amp;P leaders mean for market breadth? How Smaller Companies Contribute To Index Return The equal-weighted index shows how smaller companies are contributing to the overall market; as their performance improves, as we’re clearly seeing with the cruise lines, they frequently bring other industry peers along with them. To use a cliche that’s appropriate in this case: A rising tide can lift all - or at least other - boats. Stock market breadth is considered bullish when many stocks across various sectors and market capitalizations participate in an uptrend. A broad-based rally indicates a healthy market as more companies see positive price movements, reflecting overall investor optimism. Greater Breadth Suggests Greater Confidence A high degree of market breadth suggests broad confidence and positive sentiment, often indicating a robust and more sustainable rally. It also signifies that multiple industries and companies are contributing to the market&#039;s strength, making it less reliant on the performance of a few heavily-weighted stocks or sectors. It’s that latter point that has made investors nervous all year, even as AI, cloud computing and electric vehicles sent some stocks on rocket rides. While it’s certainly possible the market will see a pullback before year’s end, it’s statistically unlikely that 2023 will be a down year in the market. Historically, down years are most often followed by a year with S&amp;P 500 price gains. Increased breadth only makes that likelihood stronger, as it’s not up to just big techs to carry the entire market on their backs.

Okay, more like a little nonplussed. Apple’s latest moves very slightly unnerved investors, who pulled out in small numbers, leaving Apple down fractionally in Tuesday afternoon’s trading. First, Apple took a proactive stance and pulled several apps from the Chinese App Store variant ahead of China’s upcoming crackdown on generative AI systems. That means apps like ChatGPT—as well as ChatGPT itself—were pulled from the store in advance. The potential bans won’t kick in until August 15, but Apple clearly got out in front of it. The action the Chinese government looks to take isn’t even really a ban, but requires so many caveats—AI apps must not seek to overthrow the government, and must “respect social morality and ethics”, as well as promote “core values of socialism”, among other things—that it’s likely not worth trying to jump through all those hoops for the sake of a handful of apps. This news comes on the heels of much more pleasant news, as Apple also recently showed off its iPhone 15. Several “major changes” are in the offing this time around, as Apple shows off titanium edges—which might be useful in the face of, say, a dropped phone—as well as a whole new charging port. Thanks to EU regulations, the iPhone 15 and the iPhone 15 Plus will work with USB-C chargers. Analysts, meanwhile, are largely undeterred. Apple stock currently merits a Strong Buy rating, supported by 24 Buy ratings and seven Hold. Meanwhile, Apple stock also offers an upside potential of 3.34% thanks to its average price target of $202.19.

With a year-to-date gain of 57%, Amazon is outperforming the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ($NASX) in 2023, and is the second-best performing FAANG stock of the year – trailing only Meta Platforms (META) which has soared a whopping 167% this year amid its focus on “efficiency.”www.barchart.com While Amazon stock is outperforming this year, it shed almost half of its value in 2022. The stock underperformed its tech peers in 2021, as well, and barely finished that year in the green - lagging the broader market by a wide margin. Amazon to Report Q2 Earnings on Thursday Amazon is scheduled to report its Q2 earnings after the close this Thursday, Aug. 3. Analysts expect the Seattle-based company to post revenues of $131.4 billion for the period, up 8.3% year-over-year and within the $127 billion-$133 billion guidance range provided with Amazon&#039;s Q1 earnings release. Ahead of the report, analysts expect Amazon’s earnings per share (EPS) to rise 240% to $0.34 in the quarter. The company does not provide EPS guidance - but during the Q1earnings call Amazon forecast Q2 operating income between $2 billion and $5.5 billion, compared to $3.3 billion in the second quarter of 2022. www.barchart.com Beyond these headline numbers, investors should watch for several other key metrics in Amazon’s upcoming earnings release. AWS, Ad Results in Focus Investors should watch the revenue growth and margins of Amazon&#039;s North America segment for signs of continued improvement. In Q1 2023, the segment’s revenues rose 11% while operating income came in at $0.9 billion, compared to an operating loss of $1.6 billion in the first quarter of 2022. The enterprise-focused Amazon Web Services (AWS) business in particular is one to watch, as revenue growth for the segment fell to an all-time low of 16% in the first quarter. The cloud segment was previously a key driver of Amazon’s profitability and cash flows; last year, only AWS posted an operating profit, while both the North America and International segments posted an operating loss. In fact, Amazon stock fell after its Q1 2023 earnings release, as management&#039;s commentary on the lucrative AWS cloud business overshadowed the company&#039;s earnings beat. As a point of comparison, competitor Alphabet (GOOG) reported a 28% rise in its cloud revenues for the second quarter, while Microsoft (MSFT) said that Azure cloud revenues rose 26% YoY over the period. Elsewhere, Amazon said its 2023 Prime Day, held earlier in July, was its biggest ever. During theearnings call the online retailer might comment on whether it is looking to host a second Prime Day in 2023 to bolster results, as in 2022. Investors should also watch the performance of Amazon&#039;s advertising business, which generated revenues of $9.5 billion in Q1 2023 – 21% higher than the corresponding period last year. The segment has performed well, despite the overall slowdown in the digital ad market. What to Watch on the Conference Call Investors should also tune in for updates to Amazon’s guidance, especially on that crucial AWS segment. During the Q1 2023earnings call Amazon’s CFO Brian Olsavsky said, “customers continue to evaluate ways to optimize their cloud spending in response to these tough economic conditions in the first quarter.” When the company reports Q2 results later this week, investors should look for any change in tone or additional insights into how AWS customers are budgeting for the cloud amid a challenging environment for corporate spending. During theearnings call AMZN might also talk about its artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives. The company is looking to increase delivery speeds and cut logistics costs by implementing AI, and is reportedly looking to add generative AI features to the shopping platform. Plus, a leaked email suggests Amazon has also formed a new internal team focused on AI, reporting directly to CEO Andy Jassy. Finally, in response to slower revenue growth, many large-cap U.S. tech companies have resorted to aggressive cost cuts to boost their earnings, and Amazon is no exception. The company has already taken several steps to lower expenses - like pausing the construction of its HQ2 in Virginia, and cutting 27,000 corporate jobs. If Amazon provides more insights into its cost-cutting efforts on theearnings call it could be a positive catalyst. Wall Street Analysts are Bullish on Amazon Ahead of its quarterly results, Wall Street analysts are bullish on Amazon stock, and most rate it a Strong Buy. www.barchart.com Of the 36 analysts that cover AMZN, 31 rate it a Strong Buy, 4 a Moderate Buy, and 1 a Hold. None of the analysts has a Sell rating on Amazon, and its mean target price of $147.14 is 10% above current stock prices. Ahead of this week&#039;s earnings release, Evercore ISI maintained its overweight rating on the stock, and referred to AWS revenue growth as the “A-word” that could unleash value in AMZN. The brokerage has listed AMZN as one of its top Large Cap picks. Bank of America (BAC) is also bullish on AMZN heading into earnings, and believes that improvement in retail margins and AWS growth would support an expansion of the stock’s multiples. The ball is in Amazon&#039;s court as it prepares to release Q2 earnings later this week and wrap up what has been a mixed earnings season for FAANG shares so far. After a tough first quarter for the segment, don&#039;t be surprised if it&#039;s those AWS results, specifically, that drive the stock&#039;s direction immediately after earnings.

The world&#039;s most valuable firm will wrap up Big Tech earnings on Thursday, with a likely 1.6% drop in total quarterly revenue, according to Refinitiv - its steepest drop in third-quarter revenue since 2016. IPhone sales likely fell more than 2% in the period, according to 24 analysts polled by Visible Alpha, compared with a near 3% increase a year earlier and a 1.5% rise in the quarter ended March. The quarterly report could mark a break from an upbeat earnings season for the likes of Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Microsoft that have shown resilience in their cloud businesses and an uptick in digital ad sales. \"Apple is not immune to general macroeconomic trends and will continue to set the pace (for the smartphone industry) for quite some time,\" said Bob O&#039;Donnell, founder of TECHnalysis Research. With details about the new iPhone 15 expected next month - which could sport the more universally accepted USB-C port on some models - iPhone sales could get a small nudge in the July-September quarter, said analysts, who predicted a mixed bag of results for the period. Apple traditionally does not provide quarterly outlook, but analysts expect the company may elaborate how it is using AI to improve its upcoming products. The company has so far avoided buzzwords like AI at its events, in a contrast with tech giants including Alphabet and Microsoft. Last month, Bloomberg News reported Apple has quietly built its own framework to create large language models known as \"Ajax\". \"We expect Apple&#039;s updated comments on its AI aspirations to be a focus,\" analysts at Well Fargo wrote in a research note, adding that any commentary around the technology could boost the stock. Story continues Apple&#039;s shares have gained more than 50% so far this year, compared with a nearly 37% increase in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. IPHONE SLOWDOWN Much of the weakness in iPhone sales is expected to come from the Americas, where revenue is set to fall 6%, analysts said. Sales from China - Apple&#039;s third-largest market - are expected to be flat due to an uneven economic recovery, though the company has fared better than Android rivals in the country. Overall smartphone shipments to China declined 2.1% in the second quarter, according to market research firm International Data Corp. \"Most investors feel a soft China could pose a risk to the numbers and further commentary, but Apple&#039;s position in China is on a solid footing and the company is likely to see only a small, if any, decline in iPhone sales,\" Piper Sandler analysts said. \"If there is any sales weakness from China, it is likely to be easily offset by strong sales momentum in India,\" they added. Mac and iPad sales are expected to fall by 10.6% and 11.2%, respectively, according to Refinitiv data. But the services business - home to Apple&#039;s App Store and audio and video streaming services - could be a bright spot thanks to an uptick in the ad market, some analysts said. The business, which accounts for roughly a quarter of Apple&#039;s total revenue, is expected to grow 5.7% as it also benefits from price increases for iCloud subscriptions, though the pace is broadly similar to that in the preceding three quarters.

Officials from Tesla told the Indian government that they’d like some of their Chinese suppliers to establish operations in India to bolster the supply chain.According to sources speaking to Reuters, Indian authorities proposed that Tesla adopt Apple Inc’s AAPL method, which involved gaining approvals for Chinese suppliers through local joint-venture partners. Direct approval for wholly-owned Chinese companies can prove challenging due to the intense scrutiny they’ve faced since the 2020 border disputes between India and China on their Himalayan border.Why it matters? India’s tense relationship with China, following the 2020 border clashes, complicates Tesla’s plans to utilize crucial Chinese suppliers for parts that India lacks locally. This problem isn’t unique to Tesla; even the local Tata Motors sources battery cells from China.In recent months, the Indian government has accepted some joint-venture partnerships between Chinese suppliers and Indian firms on a case-by-case basis.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter: \"Dramatic valuation differences across market cap sizes continue. This has been the case for some time now. Perhaps I have spent too much time discussing these dichotomies, as generally, I feel like if we pick the right stocks and manage market exposures thoughtfully, our equities- oriented portfolio will prosper across various market cycles. However, when markets become as lopsided as they have lately, I feel additional discussion on the market environment is worthwhile, if only to help highlight the opportunities that are available and the likely path forward. I expect future discussions to soon be focused again on our moderately concentrated portfolio. But for now, let’s take one last in-depth look at how far reaching these valuation dichotomies have again become.(Please note: charts that accompany the following can be found in the Appendix.) Take Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for example. It is the largest stock by market cap, and fairly considered one of the best companies in the world.

Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, who has an outperform rating on Apple (AAPL), said that recent supply chain checks from Asia should show \"at least\" in-line results with potential for revenue from the iPhone to top estimates, citing a \"clear uptick\" in demand in China, along with higher average selling prices. \"It&#039;s (sic) unique that this late in the iPhone cycle with iPhone 15 around the corner this Fall, Apple is seeing such strong iPhone 14 demand which will front and center for the Street and the broader tech industry this week,\" Ives wrote in an investor note. In addition, Ives said he is expecting that Services revenue should \"be on the upswing\" heading into fiscal 2024, citing strength in the App Store. \"The entire Street will be laser focused on Apple&#039;s quarter as when Cook talks everyone else listens given Apple&#039;s unique perch and perspective around consumer demand globally and what this means for the path looking forward,\" Ives added. Monness, Crespi, Hardt analyst Brian White, who has a buy rating on Apple (AAPL) shares, said he is expecting 1% growth in the quarter, with the tech giant the \"best house in a downtrodden neighborhood.\" \"Although the smartphone industry remains under pressure, we believe Apple can continue to outperform the market at large,\" White wrote in an investor note. Additionally, White said that he expects Mac revenue to improve from the 31% decline seen in the previous quarter, while iPad sales are expected to tick down 5% year-over-year. Conversely, White expects Wearables, Home and Accessories sales to rise 7% to $8.65B. A consensus of analysts are forecasting Apple to earn $1.19 per share on $81.82B in revenue. In addition to the all-important iPhone, investors will be looking to hear on how Apple (AAPL) is doing in India. The company has opened its first two official stores in the country - one in Mumbai and the other in New Delhi - and the company&#039;s manufacturing partners have been building out capabilities in the country as Apple (AAPL) looks to diversify its supply chain and woo customers in the East Asian country to buy its products and services. On Monday, Bloomberg reported that Foxconn, one of Apple&#039;s (AAPL) key manufacturing partners, was getting ready to invest $500M in two component factories in the Indian state of Karnataka. In May, Foxconn, also known as HonHai Precision (OTCPK:HNHPF), invested $500M in a new manufacturing space in the Indian state of Telangana, the state&#039;s IT minister said. During its most recent quarter, Apple (AAPL) said it generated $6B in revenue from India. Investors will also be looking for any updates on the company&#039;s AI initiatives. During the company&#039;s most recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said progress on AI needs to be more nuanced than some in the tech space would have people believe. \"I do think it&#039;s very important to be deliberate and thoughtful in how you approach these things,\" Cook said in response to a question related to generative AI. \"And there&#039;s a number of issues that need to be sorted,\" Cook added. \"As is being talked about in a number of different places. But the potential is certainly very interesting.\" Since then, it has been reported the company has built an internal ChatGPT-style chatbot for its own employees as seeks out a space in the generative artificial intelligence space.

The offering could raise as much as $10B and the roadshow is slated to occur the first week of September, with pricing set for the following week, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. While the $60B valuation on Arm is underscored by investors&#039; appetite for artificial intelligence, executives for the company could try to press for an $80B valuation, the news outlet added, citing one of the people. It was previously reported that the valuation for the firm had ranged between $30B and $70B. Last month, it was reported that Arm had spoken to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) about being an anchor investor in the offering. Arm has also spoken to a number of tech companies, including Intel (INTC), Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), and Samsung Electronics (OTCPK:SSNLF) about participating in the IPO. In February 2022, Nvidia (NVDA) abandoned its deal to acquire Arm for approximately $40B due to pressure from global regulators and other semiconductor companies. Investment banks reportedly leading the offering include Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), J.P. Morgan (NYSE:JPM), Barclays (BCS) and Mizuho Financial. Arm has been trying to raise the price of its chip designs in an effort to boost sales ahead of its upcoming initial public offering. The company designs processors for electronics and licenses its technology as intellectual property to several tech companies around the world, including Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Qualcomm (QCOM) and others. Arm scrapped plans for a London listing in July 2022 due to the political situation in the U.K. government at the time. Seeking Alpha reported that the resignations of a U.K. investment minister and digital minister, who had played leading roles in talks with SoftBank () led to the breakdown in talks. Arm CEO Rene Haas said in February that the semiconductor design company was \"committed\" to having an IPO this year. Arm was purchased by SoftBank () in 2016 for $32B.

AAPL may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report. That is because Apple is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for AAPL in this report. In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently higher than the broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for AAPL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.66% heading into earnings season. Apple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Apple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Apple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. Quote Why is this Important?

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is having one of those days today, as it was the beneficiary of major new developments, yet none of those were enough to compel investor interest. Apple slipped somewhat in Wednesday afternoon’s trading despite new product announcements and welcome updates from analysts. One of the major developments to hit Apple today was a report from JPMorgan, who—via analyst Samik Chatterjee—hiked the price target on Apple from $190 to $235 per share. Chatterjee noted that Apple is in a great position to keep investors confident in its path forward, a point reflected in the price target set, which is now a new high. Further, Chatterjee pointed out that Apple’s success in replacement cycles in hardware, as well as its ongoing potential for growth in its services sector, should work well together to produce cash flow at any time. It also helps that Apple is moving to keep its hardware lines up to date. Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst with TF International Securities, recently noted that the second-generation Apple AirTag was likely to go into wide production next year, most likely in the fourth quarter. Though it’s changed substantially over the last few years, that’s right around prime time for the holiday shopping season, especially if Apple can angle it toward the front of the fourth quarter rather than the back. Also coming in late 2024 is the Vision Pro headset, which will also set up a whole new line of business for Apple. Analysts, meanwhile, don’t have much trouble supporting Apple. With 24 Buy ratings and seven Hold, Apple stock is considered a Strong Buy by analysts. Meanwhile, with an average price target of $203.64, Apple stock also offers investors a 5.56% upside potential.

As the analyst shifted his investment timeframe from 2023 to 2024, he issued a 2024 price target of $235, up from his 2023 price target of $190. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained an Outperform rating and a 12-month price target of $220.Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring has an Overweight rating and a $220 price target. The tech giant is the firm&#039;s top pick.Apple An Earnings Compounder, JPMorgan Says: “We see Apple well positioned to drive higher confidence from the upcoming earnings print as an ‘earnings compounder’ that continues to drive resilient performance,” said Chatterjee in a note.As Apple moves away from the revenue declines that started in the December quarter of 2022 to potentially growing revenue in the September quarter of 2023, investors will likely be further convinced of the replacement cycle drivers for hardware products and diversified growth drivers in Services, the analyst said.JPMorgan expects Apple to report above-consensus June quarter earnings per share and revenue of $1.23 and $81.9 billion, respectively. The upside will likely come from strength in iPhone, Mac and Services businesses, the analyst added.Chatterjee also forecasts above-consensus September quarter guidance from the company, thanks to improving Chinese demand, ad revenue rebound for the Services segment and moderating forex headwinds.

He based his optimism on stable iPhone builds, seasonal Mac strength, low-teens Services growth, and continued secular and cyclical margin tailwinds.“Importantly, this creates a setup where we expect positive estimates revisions post-earnings, after 5 consecutive quarters of Apple guiding forward quarter estimates below consensus,” the analyst said.“As a result, we see earnings next Thursday as a positive stock catalyst that can help Apple shares re-rate towards our unchanged $220 price target,” he added.The analyst calls for a double-digit year-over-year decline in iPhone and iPad revenue in the June quarter due to cycle dynamics and tougher comparisons. Mac revenue may have grown 4% and Services revenue is likely to have increased by 8.8%, thanks to 6% App Store growth, he added.Apple Price Action: At last check, Apple shares were down 1.63% to $192.44, according to Benzinga Pro data.Read Next:\n\n---\n\n[2023-08-03] 2023-08-02 19:47:00\n标题: Top Apple Analyst Dan Ives Thinks Earnings Will Be a 'Flex the Muscles Moment' For Company\n内容: The largest company in the world is set to report earnings after the bell Wednesday.

Now it&#039;s time to hear from two of the other key pillars of the U.S. economy: Apple and Amazon. The twin tech giants, which collectively account for more than $4 trillion of market cap as well as billions of dollars of consumer and business spending, are due to report quarterly earnings after Thursday&#039;s market close. The companies&#039; results—and just as importantly, their forecasts for the coming months—will add vital data that could confirm recent hopes that a , or about the business landscape. “When Cook talks everyone else listens given Apple&#039;s unique perch and perspective around consumer demand globally and what this means for the path looking forward,” Wedbush’s Dan Ives wrote in a recent note to investors. From the sales of iPhones and Macs, to the volume of online shopping and the spending by companies on cloud computing services, Apple and Amazon together provide one of the most well-rounded snapshots of market conditions. Amazon, which employs more than 1.5 million workers, is the world’s second largest online retailer (in addition to owning the Whole Foods supermarket chain, which Bloomberg recently reported is being overhauled in a bid by Amazon to go after Walmart’s brick-and-mortar empire). In July, Amazon announced that it had experienced the largest Prime Day sales ever. Prime members purchased over 375 million items and saved more than $2.5 billion in total (Amazon did not say how much money shoppers actually spent), compared to 300 million items and $1.7 billion last year. This revenue won’t show up in the second quarter results, but it’s a positive sign for consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of U.S. GDP. Taylor Swift vs the iPhone D. A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote in a recent report that the Prime Day numbers could raise hopes of a spending pickup in the home and consumer electronics categories, following a phase in which post-COVID “revenge travel” and in-person, live events have captured a lot of consumers’ discretionary income. Story continues or , Apple may have a hard time competing right now—especially given that the iPhone is awaiting its Fall upgrade to a new model. Analysts expect Apple to post its third consecutive year-over-year revenue decline during the recently ended quarter, and many investors will be more interested in the company’s outlook for the remainder of the year. D. A. Davidson’s Forte told Fortune the iPhone is more like a consumer staple than a discretionary item — it’s a necessity, not a rewarding purchase. That’s not a bad thing in a challenging macro-economic environment — iPhones keep selling while consumers do without other products. And indeed, Apple&#039;s stock is up nearly 60% this year, as investors find comfort in its stable business. But while expectations for iPhone sales are modest, Forte says a key question is what it would mean if iPhone sales do worse than expected? “If Apple reports weaker than expected iPhone sales...then it would suggest that the macroeconomic pressure may be negatively affecting products that we perceive to be a consumer staple, not a discretionary item,” Forte said. Many investors will also be looking to overseas markets like China and India for signs of strength in Apple’s business and in the global economy. Amazon&#039;s cloud barometer If consumer spending disappoints in Apple’s or Amazon’s reports, the performance of Amazon’s cloud business could become particularly important to the broader economic picture. When the Commerce Department reported that U.S. GDP increased 2.4% in Q2, it noted that business spending surged by 7.7%. That&#039;s an encouraging sign for cloud computing services that cater to corporate customers. Amazon’s cloud rivals delivered mixed results in the second quarter, with Microsoft reporting weaker-than-expected cloud revenue growth, while Google’s cloud business posted its first ever profit. Analysts expect Amazon’s AWS cloud business revenue to increase by 9% year-over-year in Q2, according to CRN. While Amazon AWS is in a fierce battle for market share against Microsoft and Google, its position as the dominant cloud provider makes it an important gauge of broader corporate cloud spending. For Amazon investors as well as for those reading economic tea leaves, the AWS outlook will provide plenty of fuel for thought.

AAPL CEO to share the wealth with creators on Twitter, now rebranded as “X.” What Happened: On Wednesday, Musk shared his intention to speak to Apple CEO regarding the implications of the tech giant’s current 30% revenue-sharing policy. The tech billionaire said he would talk with Cook about possibly adjusting the fee to 30% of what “X” keeps. The move aims to maximize “what creators receive” on the platform. See Also: Apple CEO Tim Cook Finds Clarity Using This Strategy: It’s A ‘Palate Cleanser For The Mind’Dogecoin co-creator Billy Markus, also known as Shibetoshi Nakamoto on “X,” joined the conversation and urged Cook to share more wealth with creators, saying Apple has plenty of money that the company can share with creators.Musk further said that while the microblogging site had initially said they’d keep nothing for the first year and only 10% after that period, they now promise to keep no percentage until payouts go beyond $100,000. After that also, they’ll take 10%. In response to another post, Musk also revealed that a new feature is on the horizon, allowing creators to adjust the price of paid subscriptions. Why It’s Important: There has been a longstanding conflict concerning the 30% commission Cupertino levies from companies to sell their products and services on the App Store and the regulations it imposes on such apps. According to Apple, its payment system safeguards users against fraudulent activities, thereby ensuring the App Store is a secure platform for use.Photo Courtesy: Shutterstock.comCheck out more of Benzinga’s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.

Authorities in northern Hebei province raised the natural disaster emergency response level to II from III, while Beijing kept a warning in place for landslides on its outskirts, the state broadcaster and city government said. The Hai river basin, where five rivers converge in northern China, is going through a \"flood evolution process\" and flood-control engineering systems are experiencing the \"most severe test\" since inundations in 1996, state media reported. Floodwaters could take up to a month to recede in Hebei province, where Zhuozhou is the hardest hit city, a water resources department official told state media. About 100,000 people in the city southwest of Beijing were forced to leave their homes by the rising waters. The floods have spread since Typhoon Doksuri swept into southern China on Friday. The remnants of the typhoon have started drifting into northeast China after breaking a 140-year rainfall record in Beijing and dumping more than a year&#039;s rain in Hebei province earlier this week. While the rain has eased, scores of reservoirs have been enabled to divert and trap floodwater as it flows downstream, state broadcaster CCTV reported. China is facing more stormy weather with Typhoon Khanun currently swirling over the East China Sea towards Japan, and forecast to approach China&#039;s Zhejiang and Fujian provinces by Friday. American phonemaker Apple Inc AAPL.O Chief Executive Tim Cook said in a post on popular microblog Weibo that the company will donate to the flood-relief efforts in Beijing and Hebei.

The service offered in collaboration with Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS was launched in April.Just after the launch, reports suggested the account drew in over $1 billion in deposits within four days.The savings account promises a yield of 4.15% even when financial services giants pay literally no interest for the deposits their clients park with them.

TASS said it was the first time Apple had been fined for that offence. Apple did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. The company paused all product sales in Russia shortly after Moscow sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022, and limited its Apple Pay service in Russia.

Microsoft Threat Intelligence (MTI) said in a blog post that it has identified highly targeted social engineering attacks using credential theft phishing lures sent as Microsoft Teams chats by an entity which the company tracks as Midnight Blizzard (previously tracked as NOBELIUM). MTI&#039;s current investigation suggests that the campaign has affected fewer than 40 unique global organizations. The attack pattern seen in malicious activity since at least late May 2023 suggests it&#039;s part of larger credential attack campaign that MTI attributes to Midnight Blizzard. In the the latest activity, the hackers used previously compromised Microsoft 365 tenants owned by small businesses to create new domains which appear as technical support entities. Using these domains from compromised tenants, Midnight Blizzard uses Teams messages to send lures which attempt to steal credentials from a targeted organization by engaging a user and inducing approval of multifactor authentication (MFA) prompts, according to the researchers. \"Microsoft has mitigated the actor from using the domains and continues to investigate this activity and work to remediate the impact of the attack,\" said MTI. Midnight Blizzard is a Russia-based threat actor attributed by the U.S. and the U.K. governments as the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation, also called the SVR, MTI noted.

Its shares have returned more than 30% just in the past six months, pushing the tech giant past a $3 trillion valuation. The market is clearly bullish on the company’s growth potential. Investors want to know whether it is time to take profits or if the momentum can continue. Investors are also excited about prospects for the new iPhone 15 which is scheduled to launch in September. How many new phones will Apple sell and how will it guide for the holiday quarter? These answers will be more clear when the tech giant reports third quarter fiscal 2023 earnings results after the closing bell Thursday. However, for this quarter, it’s not going to be just about the iPhone. Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng expects Apple to surpass earnings estimates, led by strength in its Mac and Services segments. Ng is expecting Services revenue of $21.8 billion to rise 11% year over year, clearing Wall Street forecasts of $20.7 billion. “Upside to our Services forecast reflects the inflection in App Store spending, per Sensor Tower, strong growth in advertising, continued content investments in AppleTV, and a more benign forex headwind relative to company guidance of -400 bps,\" Ng wrote in an investor note. The market will also look for additional details about the its long-awaited mixed reality headset, dubbed Vision Pro, which was unveiled at the company&#039;s Worldwide Developers Conference. Wall Street analysts were impressed, including Credit Suisse analyst Shannon Cross who said the device \"solves many of the technical limitations.” At a hefty price tag of $3,499, the questions becomes how much revenue and profits can Apple expect upon launch. This and other topics will be front and center on the conference call with analysts on Thursday. In the three months that ended June, Wall Street expect the Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant to earn $1.19 per share on revenue of $81.63 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to $1.20 per share on revenue of $82.96 billion. For the full year, ending in October, earnings are expected to decline 2.2% year over year to $5.98 per share, while full-year revenue of $384.99 billion will decline 2.4% year over year. The tech giant has benefited from, among other things, the re-opening of China, its second-largest market. Despite the overall smartphone market shrinking amid an economic slowdown, recent reports suggests Apple is still gaining share in the Chinese smartphone market during the second-quarter, with iPhone sales rising 6.1%. Apple’s overall Chinese smartphone market shares stands at 15.3%, according to research firm IDC, which noted a 2.1% decline in Q2 smartphone shipments in China. It’s notable that Apple still experienced growth. Could that be a sign of things to come during the quarterly results given that iPhone sales generate a sizable portion of revenues? This was the theme in the second quarter, with Apple beating on both the top and bottom lines, thanks to 1.5% rise in iPhone sales to $51.33 billion. With Q2 revenue of $94.84 billion, down 3% year over year, this means iPhone sales accounted for 54% of the overall total. This was Apple&#039;s first quarterly revenue drop in almost four years. Apple earned an adjusted EPS of $1.52 which was 8 cents better than estimates. Services revenue, which includes subscriptions to products such as Apple TV+, iCloud storage and Apple Music, rose 5.5% year over year to $20.91 billion, accounting for 22% of revenue. On Thursday investors will be watching closely to see whether (or how) inflation might have impacted spending on Apple’s pricey hardware and how the company guides for the next quarter and full year.

With the aim of decentralizing its supply chain from China, Apple is investing heavily in producing the new iPhone 15 in India.What Happened? Apple aims to manufacture 15 million iPhone 15 units in India this year, states a Nikkei report. Previously, India lagged one year behind China in new iPhone production, but in 2022, the gap shrunk to about a month. This year, the aim is to further trim this delay to less than 10 days.Historically, China has been responsible for 95% of iPhone production since the debut of the first model in 2007. Now, Apple is looking to shift at least 20% of iPhone 15 production to India, shifting away from the “Assembled in China” tag.Apple’s plans for India include not just assembly, but also the creation of intermediate components such as metal casings. In addition, the company wants to migrate some iPhone product development resources from China to India, indicating the potential development of new labs and the involvement of thousands of engineers.Why the shift? This shift is fueled by several factors. Firstly, with strained US-China relations and the Biden administration forming closer ties with India, Apple sees potential benefits. Secondly, India, expected to house a billion smartphone users by 2026, could become Apple’s next big market after China. The unveiling of the iPhone 15 is expected next month, and how well India can keep pace with China in a simultaneous launch remains to be seen. Over time, this move could significantly boost India’s iPhone production.Read next: Photo by IIIARKED on Shutterstock\n\n---\n\n[2023-08-03] 2023-08-03 11:45:16\n标题: Wall Street Will Collapse If China-Taiwan War Breaks Out, Says Key Apple Supplier: 'May Only Take 10 Seconds — Not An Hour'\n内容: Founder of Apple Inc.’s AAPL lead supplier Foxconn Technology Group HNHPF, Terry Gou, warns of a potential crash in the U.S. stocks if a war involving Taiwan occurs, Bloomberg reports.The Taiwanese billionaire expressed his concerns in a Facebook post, stating that it could take as little as “10 seconds” for Wall Street to collapse in the event of a Taiwan Strait conflict.

Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore downgraded Qualcomm (QCOM) shares to hold from buy and cut his price target to $120 from $130, noting that the \"soft commentary\" from management around the upcoming quarter and incremental headwinds for next year may be a question of structural issues with the company. \"While we continue to believe the cyclical snapback is a matter of when not if (and build in such a rebound in IoT, Auto and QTL), the duration of the headwinds QCOM continues to face in its Handset segment is leading to rising structural rather than just cyclical questions (i.e. mix, pricing, post-5G lull, etc.),\" Seymore wrote in an investor note. Seymore added that \"confidence in the [company&#039;s] growth potential will remain challenged,\" citing the fact that Apple (AAPL) and now Huawei may replace Qualcomm (QCOM) in their respective smartphones with in-house modems. In March, Qualcomm (QCOM) CEO Cristian Amon said the company had \"no plans\" to provide Apple (AAPL) with modem chips in 2024. Wells Fargo analyst Gary Mobley, who has an underweight rating on Qualcomm (QCOM) and a $95 price target, also struggled to find highlights, citing continued inventory drawdowns as the smartphone market re-calibrates to lower demand due to longer replacement periods. \"We view QCOM as a relative underperformer in a risk-on market, one of the drivers for our downgrade of QCOM in late [20222],\" Mobley wrote. \"QCOM continues to see the impact of inventory drawdowns in the global handset [market] as well as the IoT [market], w/o enough offset from cont&#039;d strength in automotive.\" For the period ending June 25, Qualcomm (QCOM) earned an adjusted $1.87 per share on $8.44B in revenue. QCT revenue declined 24% year-over-year to $7.17B, while revenue related to the QTL segment declined 19% year-over-year to $1.23B. Wall Street analysts expected Qualcomm (QCOM) to earn $1.81 per share, while sales were forecast to drop nearly 22% year-over-year to $8.51B. Looking ahead, Qualcomm (QCOM) expects fourth-quarter adjusted earnings to be between $1.80 and $2 per share, with revenue between $8.1B and $8.9B. Both metrics are below Wall Street&#039;s forecasts of $1.94 per share and $8.79B, respectively. Analysts are largely bullish on Qualcomm (QCOM). It has a BUY rating from Seeking Alpha authors, while Wall Street analysts rate it a BUY. Conversely, Seeking Alpha&#039;s quant system, which consistently beats the market, rates QCOM a HOLD.

Apple does its business globally. Given Apple&#039;s consumer-focused products such as the iPhone, iPad and Mac devices, the company&#039;s performance could be considered a litmus test for the health of consumers, who fuel much of the economic activity.More importantly, Apple is the heaviest-weighted stock in both the S&amp;P 500 Index and the Nasdaq Composite Index, with weightings of 7.7% and 11.6%, respectively.

Wells Fargo analyst Gary Mobley, who has an equal-weight rating on Qorvo (QRVO), boosted his price target to $110 from $110 after the results, noting that while inventory levels are still high, but the company may be near a \"cyclical and seasonal inflection.\" \"The Jun-Q could represent both a seasonal &amp; cyclical trough for QRVO, whereby the usual seasonal uplift from Apple drives a q/q recovery into 2Q23 (w/QRVO content gains too),\" Mobley wrote in an investor note, adding that Android customers could also be \"mostly complete\" with inventory draw downs.

Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay also boosted his price target to $110 from $100 following the results and reiterated his market perform rating, noting the quarter is an \"encouraging first step\" on the road back to recovery. In addition, Ramsay said that with \"strong positioning\" at both Apple (AAPL) and Samsung (OTCPK:SSNLF) along with a significant opportunity in Chinese handset makers, a recovery is likely a matter of \"when\" and not \"if.\" KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh said the results and guidance from Qorvo (QRVO) were \"strong\" and \"solidly beat expectations,\" but the progress in getting rid of excess Android inventory is helping. \"[Second-quarter revenue] growth of 53% q/q is being driven by iPhone 15 content/share gains in the areas of AT/UHB,\" Vinh wrote in an investor note. \"[Fiscal 2024] guidance of modest [revenue] growth and 44% GM is reiterated, as inventories are expected to normalize exiting [2023].\" Looking ahead, Qorvo (QRVO) expects fiscal second-quarter revenue to be approximately $1B, plus or minus $15M, significantly higher than the $651.2M it generated in the first-quarter. Qorvo (QRVO) also expects adjusted gross margins to be between 45% and 46%, with adjusted earnings per share of approximately $1.75.

However, as is often the case on Wall Street, the stock market is the master manipulator. Whether investors caught the move or not, each is wondering what happens next. Below are five reasons stocks need to digest: Fitch Downgrade US debt was downgraded for the first (and only) time since 2011. Tuesday night, Fitch Rating Agency downgraded US debt from the highest possible rating of AAA+ to AA. While investors only have one data point to go off, in early August of 2011, S&amp;P announced the company’s decision to downgrade US sovereign debt for the first time ever. Over the next few weeks, the S&amp;P 500 corrected nearly 20% Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Wednesday’s 2% Nasdaq decline was the worst hit since February. Though such a rapid decline as 2011 is unlikely, investors should view Wednesday’s action as a warning shot in the short term. Gravity Driven by big-tech and Artificial Intelligence oriented stocks like Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL), The Nasdaq 100 has gone five months without touching the 50-day moving average. Image Source: TradingView Remember, even during the strongest bull markets, valuations begin to matter, profit taking occurs, and markets must recalibrate by correcting through time or price. Furthermore, technicians realize that the 50-day moving average tends to act like a bungy cord – when equity indexes get stretched too far away, a mean-reversion is on the horizon. Overheated Sentiment Whether you use the AAII (American Association of Individual Investors) Sentiment Survey, NAAIM Exposure Index (National Association of Active Investment Managers), or the CNN Fear &amp; Greed Index, sentiment is running hot. For example, until Wednesday, the CNN Fear/Greed Index was at “Extreme Greed” levels for over a month. Image Source: CNN As General George S. Patton once stated, “If everyone is thinking alike, then someone isn’t thinking”. Seasonality Seasonality refers to the tendency for equities to exhibit recurring patterns and behaviors at specific times of the year. Over the past ten years, August and September have been amongst the worst performing months. The magnificent run that equities have had, couples with weaker seasonality trends, should lead us to a broader pullback sooner rather than later. Punishing Stocks Post Earnings Several stocks got punished by double-digits after releasing earnings this week including SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG), Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG), and Generac (GNRC). The poor action in these stocks indicates a character change in the market from previous weeks. What Should Investors Do? · Build a watchlist using relative strength.In other words, in a sea of red, look for green. As the S&amp;P 500 notched new lows in late 2022, stocks like e.l.f Beauty (ELF) and Rambus (RMBS) were notching 52-week highs. · Don’t overtrade. In choppy, light summer trading, it can be easy to suffer from “death by a thousand cuts.” · Wait for the dust to settle.You don’t need to be the first to buy the dip. Wait for proof and interpret, don’t predict. Look for winning stocks like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) to have a higher-time frame rotation (take out a previous weekly high).

Malik, who maintained his buy rating on Apple (AAPL) said his gross margin estimates are 90 basis points above Wall Street&#039;s estimate for fiscal 2024. For the coming quarter, Malik expects Apple (AAPL) to generate $81.6B in revenue, just slightly below the Wall Street estimate of $81.8B. Looking ahead, Malik expects September results to be higher due to iPhone sales, as well as recent comments from semiconductor companies such as NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Qorvo (QRVO), both of which indicated \"strong seasonal growth\" in premium smartphones. \"In general, we believe Apple is more focused on maximizing gross profit per unit of iPhone from migration to premium phones and related services than volume,\" Malik added.

Undoubtedly, American Express stock was already a tough buy in the face of a potential economic recession. Consumer spending is expected to grind lower in the second half, threatening to drag down the broader basket of payments plays. In any case, I do think the bar has already been lowered quite a bit for American Express going into what’s shaping up to be a headwind-filled couple of quarters. Indeed, travel and entertainment already had its moment to recover from the worst of the pandemic. In that regard, the easy gains already seem to have been made. Regardless, longer-term thinkers still have plenty of reasons to hang onto the stock, even if analysts begin to turn their back on the name. My bull case isn’t just about timing the macro headwinds that may lie ahead. American Express has plenty of intriguing growth levers it may wish to pull as the payments space collides with cutting-edge fintech technologies and AI. For that reason, I’m staying bullish on American Express stock and continue to see it as one of the better value offerings in the market right now. American Express Stock Slapped with a Downgrade American Express posted a pretty mixed bag for its second quarter. The company beat on earnings (EPS of $2.89 vs. $2.81 estimate) but missed on revenue ($15.05 billion vs. $15.5 billion estimate). The post-earnings reaction was quite negative despite management’s guidance reiteration, which calls for 15-17% revenue growth for the year. Many investors may be feeling the initial chilly breeze of that potentially-looming recession. Piper Sandler’s Kevin Barker slapped the stock with a “Sell,” while slashing AXP’s price target to $149 from $172, implying downside of over 10% from current levels. Barker sees growth and margin pressures at the hands of student loan debt repayments coming due later in the year. Indeed, it’s a notable headwind but one that may be offset by a softer-than-expected landing for the economy. At this pace, a soft landing does seem likely. However, whether the student loan headwinds weigh down AXP stock further remains to be seen. For now, the tough quarter and significant downgrade have made AXP stock that much cheaper, and I’m a fan while shares trade at 16.9 times trailing price-to-earnings, well below the credit services industry average of 22.4 times. Inheriting Apple’s Partnership from Goldman Sachs Could be a Shot in the Arm Just a month ago, a Wall Street Journal report noted investment banking behemoth Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) was looking to offload its Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Card and Savings products, possibly to American Express. Indeed, we haven’t heard anything new about the matter since. Still, one has to view a potential partnership with Apple as a sizeable opportunity to catch up to the likes of its larger credit card and payment peers. Right now, it’s hard to tell if American Express and Apple will form a relationship as Goldman Sachs looks to take a walk. However, the fact that Warren Buffett‘s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) owns a hefty stake in each firm makes such a partnership that much more interesting. Further, Apple’s tech expertise and more than one billion iPhone userbase could come in handy as American Express looks to extend its reach across the U.S. and abroad. For now, an American Express-backed Apple Card doesn’t seem to make a lot of sense, given that it’s not exactly the most accepted credit card in the world. It seems like nearly everybody has an iPhone, but very few folks actually have an American Express card. Still, this could change if American Express takes over for Goldman at some point in the near future. Over the years, American Express has made huge strides regarding acceptance across the U.S. market. Reportedly, around 99% of American merchants now accept American Express cards. Also, if the credit card giant can increase acceptance internationally, possibly with some help from Apple, I do see a scenario where American Express may have a pathway to really close the gap with its credit card peers. Is AXP Stock a Buy, According to Analysts? Turning to Wall Street, AXP stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 13 analyst ratings, there have been five Buys, five Holds, and four Sell recommendations assigned in the past three months. The average American Express stock price target is $178.54, implying upside potential of 7.2%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $125 per share to a high of $203 per share. The Bottom Line on American Express Stock Even if American Express doesn’t end up backing Apple’s financial products, expect the credit card firm to continue staying on its toes on the front of innovation. Indeed, American Express is just another old-school company dabbling with generative AI through its Amex Digital Labs division. Over the next few years, there’s hope that AI innovations could help American Express widen its moat and give its growth a jolt. For now, I think investors and analysts are too nearsighted when it comes to the name following an underwhelming quarter and a remarkable quarterly downgrade from Piper Sandler.

The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose as high as 4.198% during the session, the highest since November, extending its climb from a day earlier following Fitch&#039;s downgrade of the top-tier U.S. credit rating. “It was a carryover from yesterday&#039;s fear.

The stock was trading lower heading into the event. When the tech giant printed its second-quarter results on May 4, the stock surged 4.69% the following day and continued in its uptrend, which eventually led Apple to reach a new all-time high of $198.23 on July 19. For that quarter, Apple reported EPS of $1.52 on revenue of $94.8 billion. The company came in ahead of estimates for EPS of $1.43 on revenues of $92.96 billion. For the third quarter, analysts estimate that Apple will print earnings per share of $1.09 on revenues of $74.24 billion. Ahead of the event, JP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee maintained an Overweight rating on the stock and raised a price target from $190 to $235. Read more here… From a technical analysis perspective, Apple&#039;s stock looks neutral heading into the event, having broken bearishly from a rising channel and negated its uptrend but on low volume, which indicates Thursday&#039;s drop could be a bear trap. It should be noted that holding stocks or options over an earnings print is akin to gambling because stocks can react bullishly to an earnings miss and bearishly to an earnings beat. Options traders, particularly those who are holding close-dated calls or puts, take on the extra risk because the institutions writing the options increase premiums to account for implied volatility.

The Apple Chart: Apple dropped under the bottom ascending trend line of a rising channel pattern on Thursday but on lower-than-average volume. If the stock receives a bullish reaction to its earnings print and pops back up into the pattern, it may find resistance at the upper ascending trend line of the channel. On Thursday, Apple was working to print a doji candlestick on the daily chart, which suggests the stock may trade higher on Friday. If Apple suffers a bearish reaction to the news, however, the candlestick will be negated and the stock could fall to test support at the 50-day simple moving average, which is trending at about $187. If the stock rises but fails to form a higher high over the next few trading days, a downtrend will be confirmed, regardless of whether the stock temporarily trades back within the channel. If Apple falls on Friday, volatility in the stock market is likely to increase. Traders wishing to play the potential volatility in the stock market can use MIAX&#039;s SPIKES Volatility products.

Revenue fell 1.4% year-over-year, marking the third consecutive period of declines. Revenue has slid for multiple quarters as Mac and iPad sales have flagged.

Apple CEO Tim Cook holds one of the company&#039;s new MacBooks on the Apple campus Monday, June 5, 2023, in Cupertino, Calif.

The quarterly report arrived just weeks ahead of Apple’s new hardware lineup, including the iPhone 15 and the next slate of smartwatches. Apple’s earnings, which arrived alongside Amazon’s, round out the quarterly reports from the major tech companies, following better-than-expected results from Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and a revenue miss from Microsoft last week. The tech sector has surged this year, riding optimism on cutting-edge AI technology, the resiliency of online advertising, and growth in cloud services.

AAPL CEO Tim Cook has revealed that he has been using the company’s first-generation mixed-reality headset Vision Pro daily. What Happened: During Apple’s third-quarter earnings call, Cook expressed enthusiasm about Vision Pro’s capabilities and reception among the press, analysts, and developers. With units already being shipped to the developer community for app development, the product will start “shipping early next year.”See Also: Apple’s iPhone 15 Pro Max May Hit Your Wallet Hard With $1,299 Price TagWhile the tech mogul didn’t speak about any revenue forecasts related to the device, he did mention incorporating Vision Pro into his daily routine. “I’m using the product daily.”In June this year, Cupertino started allowing developers to craft their own “spatial experiences” — a blend of virtual and augmented reality software — for the highly anticipated Vision Pro headset. It was previously reported that while Apple has demonstrated the Vision Pro’s integration with apps like FaceTime and Safari, the company’s main focus is on external developers using the VisionOS AR infrastructure to release the hardware’s full potential.Drawing inspiration from the App Store’s role in the iPhone’s success, Apple aims to replicate that triumph with the Vision Pro.Why It’s Important: Earlier this year, Meta Platforms Inc. META CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that he doesn’t think Apple Vision Pro has any “magical” technological advancements, but Cupertino’s entry in the AR/VR segment would give more “validation to the category.” It is pertinent to note that Apple’s Vision Pro would come with a hefty price tag of $3,499, starkly contrasting with Meta’s upcoming Quest 3 headset, priced at $499.

However, many users get defensive about their platforms and treat their favorite companies as sacred.One of these rivalries that has been constant over the last decade is Apple Inc. AAPL and Alphabet Inc.&#039;s GOOGL GOOG Google – the iOS vs Android debate has always sparked debates about who copied whom.The reality is less controversial – both Apple and Google have copied each other several times and will likely continue to do so in the future. Despite this, several differences make both iOS and Android unique in their own right.In this story, we look at some features that Apple borrowed from Android or even the ancient Nokia phones running the Symbian operating system.See Also: Keep Your Pictures Safe From AI Using These Tools iPhone Features That Were Already Available On Android Or Nokia Phones1. Standby ModeOne of the highlights of the iOS 17 update is Standby Mode. It turns iPhones into a sort of smart display. At its core, though, it is a variation of always-on display, a feature that has been available on Android smartphones for a long time.But that&#039;s not it – Nokia introduced it back in 2008 with the iconic Nokia N70 and Nokia 6303. It further refined the feature in 2010 with the iconic Nokia N8.2. Home Screen WidgetsHome screen widgets are another nifty addition to iOS – Apple introduced them in 2020 with iOS 14, allowing users to glance at information and do more without having to open apps.Android phones have supported home screen widgets for over a decade. Prior to it, Nokia phones also supported them across a range of apps, including email, calendar, and more.3. Lock Screen CustomizationApple also introduced some more important customization options with iOS 16, with the lock screen being one of them. With this update, Apple allowed users to change the clock&#039;s font, add widgets, emojis, and more to make it their own.On the other hand, Android phones have allowed lock screen customization for a long time. Google also allowed widgets at one point but removed them in Android 5.0. Fortunately, the open nature of Android means that companies like Samsung and others have allowed widgets in different capacities.4. Default AppsOne of the criticisms of iOS for a long time was the inability to set default apps, a feature that has been available on Android for a long time. Thankfully, Apple has ceded some ground here, allowing users to change the default email and web browsing apps. Apple still has more work to do here, but this is a start.5. App LibraryApple introduced a new feature called App Library in iOS 14. It is basically an app drawer, and Apple also automatically categorizes apps into groups like Social, Entertainment, and more.Android phones have had app drawers for a long time, and of late, launchers have also had automatic app categorization features available.6. Picture-in-Picture ModeGoogle introduced picture-in-picture mode with Android 8.0. This allows users to enjoy clips from apps like YouTube or Netflix in a small floating video while using other apps or performing other tasks.

While these top technology stocks are buzzing on Reddit and have significantly gained mentions, they have appreciated quite a lot on a year-to-date basis. Despite the rally in their prices, analysts’ average price targets indicate further upside in these stocks. Against this backdrop, let’s delve into these trending Reddit stocks. Can Apple&#039;s Stock Keep Going Up? Apple stock has gained about 47.56% year-to-date. However, its stock is down over 2% in after-hours trading following its third-quarter financial results. Though its earnings came ahead of the Street’s projection, the decline in sales of the iPhone, iPad, and Mac didn’t go well with investors. The decline in sales reflects tough year-over-year comparisons and macro uncertainty. Nonetheless, its Services revenue reached $21.2 billion, driven by more than one billion paid subscriptions. Following Q3 earnings, Goldman Sachs analyst Mike Ng reiterated a Buy recommendation on Apple stock on August 3. The analyst said that “certain elements of F3Q23 results were disappointing vs. Consensus.” Nevertheless, the company’s growing installed base of paid subscriptions will drive “secular growth in Services” and support its premium valuation. Overall, Apple stock has received 24 Buy and seven Hold recommendations for a Strong Buy consensus rating. Analysts’ average price target of $203.64 implies 6.52% upside potential from current levels. Is Amazon Stock Expected to Rise? Amazon stock has gained over 53% year-to-date. Further, the stock is up about 8.73% in after-hours trading following its solid second-quarter results. AMZN Q2 earnings crushed Wall Street’s estimates. Meanwhile, analysts’ average price target indicates that Amazon stock could rise more. The increase in the e-commerce business, led by macro improvement and cost reduction measures, supported AMZN’s Q2 performance. Moreover, signs of stabilization in the cloud business (AWS) and ongoing momentum in its advertising segment position it well to deliver solid growth in the coming quarters. Eric Sheridan of Goldman Sachs maintained his bullish view of Amazon stock following Q2 earnings results. The analyst expects the company to benefit from improving margins in the e-commerce business. Further, the ongoing digital transformation will support its AWS segment. At the same time, Amazon will also benefit from the growing scale of its advertising business. Along with Sheridan, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik, and Nicholas Jones of JMP Securities reiterated the Buy rating on AMZN stock following Q2 financial results. Amazon stock has received a Buy recommendation from all 29 analysts who have recently rated it. Collectively, their 12-month average price target of $86.20 implies an upside of nearly 16%. What is the Future of AMD Stock? Shares of Advanced Micro Devices will likely benefit from the solid demand for chips that power AI (Artificial Intelligence) applications. At the same time, the recovery in PC demand will support its financials, in turn, its stock. AMD recently delivered better-than-expected earnings. The company’s management expects the PC market to grow in the second half of 2023, which is encouraging. Additionally, the growing AI deployments in the data center market augur well for growth. As AI presents a multibillion-dollar growth opportunity for the company, Tristan Gerra of Robert W. Baird reiterated a Buy on AMD stock on August 1. The analyst expects AMD’s gross margins to expand significantly in 2024, led by “the ramp of AI” and easier year-over-year comparisons in the Embedded segment (which includes embedded CPUs and GPUs). Overall, AMD stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating on TipRanks, reflecting 25 Buy and six Hold recommendations. Analysts’ average price target of $142.51 implies 25.95% upside potential. The Bottom Line AAPL, AMZN, and AMD stocks are trending on Reddit and have multiple growth engines to drive their stock prices higher. In addition, analysts’ Strong Buy consensus rating supports the bull case. As these stocks appear to be attractive long-term bets, Wall Street analysts’ average price targets show that AMD offers the highest upside potential.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index .STOXX edged up 0.1% after shedding about 3% in the past three sessions. Wall Street futures also rose as a strong forecast from Amazon.com IncAMZN.O outweighed a downbeat sales outlook from iPhone maker AppleAAPL.O. The focus largely was on U.S. payrolls data, due at 1230 GMT, which is expected to show job growth likely slowed further in July but retained enough momentum to shield the economy from a recession. \"Having just come off the back of another 25 basis points rate hike from the Federal Reserve last week and what may well be the final rate hike of this cycle, the U.S. payrolls data is likely to continue to showcase the resilience of the U.S. economy,\" Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said in a note. Stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic have rallied in recent weeks, driven by signs of resilience in the U.S. economy and hopes that major central banks are near the end of their monetary tightening cycle. However, weak data out of Europe and Asia and the surprise downgrade on the U.S. credit rating set the STOXX 600 for its first weekly loss in four. Earnings were a mixed bag in Europe. French lender Credit AgricoleCAGR.PA climbed 5.7% as strong insurance and consumer finance results helped it report upbeat quarterly earnings. Italy&#039;s state-owned bank Monte dei Paschi di SienaBMPS.MI jumped 3.0% as it posted above-forecast earnings for the second quarter. Dragging media shares down, WPPWPP.L, the world&#039;s biggest advertising group, slid 7.1% after it downgraded its full-year like-for-like growth forecast. VonoviaVNAn.DE slipped 2.5% as Germany&#039;s largest real estate group slipped to a 2 billion euro ($2.19 billion) second-quarter loss and wrote down the value of its properties by 3 billion euros. Among the STOXX 600 companies that have reported so far, 56% have beaten analysts&#039; profit estimates, as per Refinitiv IBES data. In a typical quarter, 54% top estimates. Citi strategists upgraded their earnings outlook for 2024, saying \"soft landing\" scenarios look plausible and that economically sensitive cyclical sectors should benefit the most.

Apple Inc. AAPL and carriers are preparing for the launch event likely scheduled for September 13, which aligns with Apple&#039;s usual iPhone launch time frame.What Happened: Apple and carriers in the US are gearing up for the iPhone 15 Pro launch event on September 13, reported 9to5Mac.See Also: Apple iPhone 15 Pro Could Surprise Buyers With A Price HikeCarriers have reportedly asked their employees to refrain from taking leaves on September 13 due to a major smartphone launch.Although it&#039;s unclear if they are referring to other phone launches, Apple usually launches new iPhones in September every year. It also has a 55% market share in the US, so connecting the dots suggests it is very likely the iPhone 15 series.Earlier reports from analysts suggested the iPhone 15 series launch could be delayed, citing supply chain checks. However, Apple has since then placed orders for displays, and its supplier, Samsung, has started manufacturing them.Even if there are delays, Apple could announce in September and start shipping out orders later. This has also happened, too, so it&#039;s entirely unexpected. For instance, the iPhone 14 Plus went on sale in October last year, while the launch happened on September 16.September Event Expectations: At its September event, Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 15 series along with other hardware, including the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. It is also scheduled to release the final versions of iOS 17, iPadOS 17, watchOS 10, and macOS Sonoma.Check out more of Benzinga&#039;s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.Read Next:\n\n---\n\n[2023-08-04] 2023-08-04 09:08:19\n标题: Why Apple Stock Is Losing Flavor Premarket Today\n内容: Apple, Inc. AAPL shares traded down in premarket trading on Friday as softer fiscal year third-quarter hardware product sales, with the exception of Macs, and disappointing September quarter guidance warded off investors.The company reported third-quarter earnings of $1.26 per share and revenue of $81.8 billion, exceeding the consensus estimate of $1.19 per share and $81.7 billion, respectively.Despite the headline beat, investors were worried because iPhone sales of $39.67 billion that came in shy of the consensus forecast of $40 billion. The company, however, did say iPhone’s active installed base grew to a new all-time high. iPad and Wearables, Home &amp; Accessories sales also trailed forecasts.Apple&#039;s Services business saved the day for the company, as revenue from the segment clocked a record total of $21.21 billion, exceeding the consensus estimate of $20.74 billion. CEO Tim Cook said the company had more than $1 billion in paid subscriptions for the segment.Mac sales also came in ahead of expectations amid the transition of the entire lineup to in-house chips.See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Apple StockOn the earnings call, CFO Luca Maestri said the company expects September year-over-year revenue growth to be similar to the one seen in the June quarter, which saw a 1.4% year-over-year topline decline.This should come as a surprise as most analysts, including JPMorgan&#039;s Samik Chatterjee, expected the company&#039;s year-over-year revenue decline streak to end. The company hinted at forex negatively impacting revenue by 2%.Apple also said it expects year-over-year performances of the iPhone and Services segment to accelerate from the June quarter.

Not only was this a narrower year-over-year decline than the previous quarter, but sales were better than management had anticipated and ahead of analysts&#039; average forecast. Perhaps even more important, Apple returned to earnings growth, as earnings per share came in significantly ahead of analysts&#039; consensus view for the profitability metric. Stealing the show for the quarter was Apple&#039;s services segment, which grew substantially year over year and came in at a record quarterly high. Here&#039;s a closer look at the results -- and why the quarter&#039;s performance should be viewed as a reason for shareholders to keep betting on the iPhone-maker&#039;s shares. Robust results in a challenging market Revenue was down 1% year over year despite a 4 percentage point headwind from foreign exchange. This was an improvement from a 3% year-over-year decline last quarter. Further, it&#039;s a solid result, given a challenging smartphone market in the U.S. Management said in Apple&#039;searnings callthat weak iPhone revenue in the U.S. weighed on revenue in its Americas region, which declined almost 6% year over year. As the company&#039;s biggest geographical segment, this held back the company&#039;s top line. Despite softness in Apple&#039;s Americas segment, the report included many other bright spots. First and foremost, services revenue grew 8% year over year and increased by a double-digit year-over-year rate in constant currency, according to comments from Apple chief financial officer Luca Maestri during the company&#039;s fiscal third-quarterearnings call Capturing the segment&#039;s momentum, this growth rate was an acceleration, compared to 5% year-over-year revenue growth in fiscal Q2. Importantly, management said it expects further acceleration in the company&#039;s reported services revenue growth rate in fiscal Q4. Thanks to strength outside of the Americas for the iPhone, the product segment&#039;s sales actually increased year over year on a constant-currency basis -- a testament to the resilience of Apple&#039;s biggest product line. However, iPhone revenue fell 2% year over year on a reported basis. Greater China&#039;s performance is also worth calling out. The important market returned to growth in the quarter, with sales rising 8% year over year. This compares to a 3% year-over-year decline in Greater China revenue in fiscal Q2. Perhaps most important of all was the fact that Apple returned to earnings growth. Earnings per share rose 5% year over year to $1.26. This starkly contrasts with a 3% year-over-year decline in earnings per share last quarter. Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings per share of $1.21. Results worthy of the stock&#039;s valuation Overall, the results helped justify the stock&#039;s current valuation. A return to year-over-year earnings growth, revenue growth on a constant-currency basis, and management&#039;s comments about expecting improved year-over-year performance for both services and iPhone on a reported basis in fiscal Q4 are all reasons for shareholders to be pleased with the report. While the stock isn&#039;t cheap with a price-to-earnings ratio of about 32, Apple&#039;s resilient business in a difficult environment demonstrates why the stock is worth holding onto for the long haul. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

On Thursday the Indian government imposed restrictions on import of laptops, tablets, all-in-one personal computers and ultra-small computers and servers, effect immediately. Any company which plans to bring laptops and computers for sale in India will now have to seek permission or license from the government for their incoming shipments. The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) said that exemption from import licensing is given to up to 20 items per consignment for R&amp;D, testing, benchmarking and evaluation, repair and return and product development purposes. The move is aimed at promoting domestic manufacturing of these products under a recently renewed production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for IT hardware. The last date to apply for the so-called production-linked incentives in this product category is Aug. 30. The action is also intended to curb imports of these goods from countries like China and South Korea, NDTV reported citing news agency Press Trust of India. Laptop makers had been bracing for some government action, however the sudden licensing imposition has caught the industry off-guard, the Bloomberg report added citing people with knowledge of the matter. Companies are now engaging with the government on how to quickly get licenses, ahead of festival seasons in the coming months, according to the sources. It is not clear how long it will take for the companies to get licenses, but the halt is already disrupting a multibillion-dollar trade in foreign PCs. These requirements may pose additional hurdles for manufacturers who are already facing global excess inventory and triggers to restart sales growth. This could lead to delayed launches or even product shortages in India, which is still largely reliant on imports from overseas, the report added. The Indian government is currently seeking applications for INR 170B financial incentive plan to attract manufacturers of laptops, tablets and other hardware as companies start to look beyond China for their supply chain needs.

What Happened: During the third quarter earnings call, Cook shed light on the company’s extensive research spanning various AI technologies, including generative AI akin to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. ChatGPT, released in November last year, has gained widespread recognition for its language processing capabilities and natural conversation generation. The technology almost single-handedly started an AI arms race among big tech companies like Alphabet Inc. GOOG GOOGL and Microsoft Corporation MSFT. See Also: Is ChatGPT 5 Coming Soon? Here’s What You Need To KnowDuring the call, Cook emphasized the integral role of AI and machine learning in Apple’s product ecosystem. He cited examples of recent innovations showcased at the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference, such as Personal Voice and Live Voicemail, which were made possible by AI advancements. He also mentioned previously announced life-saving features like fall detection, crash detection, and ECG, all of which relied on the power of AI and machine learning.“None of these features that I just mentioned and many, many more would be possible without AI and machine learning. And so it’s absolutely critical to us,” Cook said. Why It’s Important: Staying true to Apple’s habit of announcing things when they’re ready for the market, Cook didn’t share anything particular about what the company is developing on the generative AI side. In May also, when Apple reported forecast-beating results for the fiscal year’s second quarter, Cook only mentioned AI in one answer, that too in a relatively vague manner. This was a surprise because other tech giants like Meta Platforms Inc. META, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN are making aggressive headways in the segment.However, an analyst previously predicted that despite Apple’s not-so-proactive approach, Cupertino could be the “one to benefit no matter where the industry goes.”Check out more of Benzinga’s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.Read Next:\n\n---\n\n[2023-08-04] 2023-08-04 09:55:00\n标题: US STOCKS-Amazon results boost U.S. futures ahead of jobs data\n内容: For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click LIVE/ or type LIVE/ in a news window. Futures up: Dow 0.24%, S&amp;P 0.46%, Nasdaq 0.63% Aug 4 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Friday as Amazon&#039;s better-than-expected earnings trumped Apple&#039;s tepid sales forecast, while investors awaited the July jobs report to firm up the likelihood of a \"soft landing\" for the economy. Amazon shares AMZN.O surged 8.8% in premarket trading after the company issued an upbeat outlook for the third quarter, while Apple&#039;s shares AAPL.O fell 1.8% as the iPhone maker forecast a continued slide in sales. Shares of peers Microsoft MSFT.O, Alphabet GOOGL.O and Snowflake SNOW.K rose between 1% and 6.2% after Amazon&#039;s cloud business segment beat sales estimates. All eyes will be squarely on the July U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, due at 8:30 a.m. ET, with a Reuters poll of economists estimating payrolls increased by 200,000 jobs last month, after having risen 209,000 in June, showing labor market conditions remain tight. A Labor Department report on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits increased slightly last week, while layoffs dropped to an 11-month low in July. \"The U.S. economy still appears to be in decent shape, concern about the manufacturing sector notwithstanding, but the services sector has remained resilient, with another solid ISM survey in July which saw prices paid tick higher, and the employment component tick lower,\" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. \"The resilience in the prices paid component feeds into the concern that rates are likely to remain higher for longer.\" The yield on the 10-year benchmark note was steady near the nine-month high it hit due, partly, to Fitch downgrading the United States from a AAA rating to AA+ earlier this week. Stocks closed marginally lower on Thursday weighed down by the latest batch of economic data and earnings downgrades.

The reports capped what has been a positive earnings season for most big U.S. tech firms from Google-owner Alphabet to Meta, thanks to a pick-up in the digital ad market and improving demand for cloud services after a nearly year-long slump. Online retail giant Amazon was set to add about $120 billion to its market value, based on premarket movements. Meanwhile Apple, the world&#039;s most valuable firm, was on course to slide below $3 trillion, with a $50 billion drop in its valuation. The better-than-expected performance of Amazon&#039;s cloud business in the second quarter also lifted other members of the coveted trillion-dollar club, with Microsoft MSFT.O and Alphabet GOOGL.O both rising more than 1%. Wall Street analysts said Amazon&#039;s estimate-beating quarterly profit and sales showed that both its key businesses can grow together after two years of \"unpleasant surprises\". \"The second quarter is a game-changing quarter for Amazon; we would call it an-all clear moment,\" said SVB MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Morton. \"Retail and AWS (Amazon Web Services) are working together. No more handwringing on retail losses or AWS optimization, but rather &#039;how high can retail margins go&#039; and &#039;when can we see the benefit of artificial intelligence at AWS?&#039;\" At least 17 analysts raised their price targets on the stock, pushing the median view to $154, according to Refinitiv data. That&#039;san upside of nearly 20% to a stock that has already risen almost 50% this year. Amazon has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 58.78, much higher than Apple&#039;s 29.5 and the industry median of 14.87. The iPhone maker warned on Thursday that it was headed for the fourth straight quarter of declining sales as demand continues to slow for its flagship device, especially in developed markets. But its services business was a bright spot and helped Apple top profit expectations for the June quarter. \"The services arm provides a welcome cushion to the group, but Apple still needs to revive hardware sales growth otherwise the market is going to worry about the next generation of customers to join its ecosphere,\" said Dan Coatsworth, stock market analyst at AJ Bell. \"It is time for Apple to launch something new and innovative, not just another variation of its core products.\" (Reporting by Aditya Soni and Samrhitha Arunasalam in Bengaluru and Joice Alves in London; Editing by Amanda Cooper and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty) ((Joice.Alves@thomsonreuters.com; Twitter @joiceal;)) The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\n\n---\n\n[2023-08-04] 2023-08-04 10:58:55\n标题: Meta's smart glasses Ray-Ban Stories fails to impress owners\n内容: Galeanu Mihai The Ray-Ban smart glasses launched by Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) about two years ago have struggled to catch the eye of the owners, many of whom don&#039;t seem to use the devices frequently, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported internal company data. Fewer than 10% of the glasses, called Ray-Ban Stories, bought since the product was launched in September 2021 are used actively by buyers, according to a company document from February. The tech giant sold about 300K wearable devices through February, but the company had only about 27K monthly active users, according to the report. Facebook built the first-generation smart glasses in partnership with EssilorLuxottica — which makes sells glasses brands such as Ray-Ban and Oakley — and the starting price of the product was $299. Ray-Ban Stories enables users to take photos and videos, listen to music and take phone calls. The product has experienced a 13% return rate, according to the report. Among the main issues for inadequate consumer experience were certain hardware features including battery life, inability for users to import media from the devices, problems with the audio on the device and issues with voice commands. \"We’ll also need to better understand why users stop using their glasses, how to ensure we are encouraging new feature adoption, and ultimately how to keep our users engaged and retained,\" as per the document. Meta intends to launch the second generation of its Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses either in the fall or next spring, the report added citing people with knowledge of the matter. The new glasses will see an improved battery life, better cameras, and will be available on more models of Ray-Ban&#039;s frames. The smart-glasses technology is currently available on three models of Ray-Ban. The second gen device is expected, like the current one, not to have features of augmented reality (AR). However, Meta executives see the Stories product as a predecessor to AR glasses, which it wishes to launch in the coming years, the report added. The Facebook parent already has virtual/mixed reality headset on the market and it third-gen Meta Quest 3 is slated to release in fall. Apple (AAPL) also unveiled its AR/VR headset in June but the company reportedly has cut production forecast due to manufacturing woes and is likely to have an appointment-only launch. The Ray-Ban Stories represent one of the most vital collaborations for Meta&#039;s Reality Labs division, which has incurred an operating loss of about $8 billion in H1 2023 and is expected to see its operating loss widen in 2024, the report added citing the executives.

On the one hand, job openings and jobless claims rose, indicating the first signs of a cooling labor market.

There is one more big report due from Nvidia (NVDA) in a few weeks, but after that there are no earnings catalysts, which is part of the reason that September tends to be soft. The earnings from Amazon were better than expected, and the stock is indicated to open about 9% higher here on Friday. The question here is whether the stock can gain momentum. When Alphabet GOOGL reported on July 26, it gapped up about 5%, but it is trading at almost the exact same level seven trading sessions later. Apple disappointed and is trading about 2% and is sitting at its 50-day simple moving average. It has not traded below that level since January of this year. Apple is a stock that is often viewed as a safe haven and is likely to attract dip buyers regardless of concerns about its valuation. This morning CITI notes that, on average, Apple is up 8% in the period following June earnings and into the next iPhone announcement. During that period, Apple has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 each time, which illustrates how the stock often serves as a safe haven during a period of weak seasonality. We&#039;ll see how these two stocks develop from here, but the bigger issue is whether the character of the market action will shift. We are seeing some toppy action, but the bears have been incapable of generating any sustained downside momentum for a while. Economic news and earnings have provided plenty of ammunition for the bulls, but both those areas are in flux now in conjunction with seasonality. We still have many small-cap earnings reports that will create speculative action in small stocks, but the bigger trends in bonds are having a substantial impact on sentiment and are causing re-evaluation of the market. My game plan is to play some of the small-cap earnings names on earnings, but I&#039;ll be watching Apple as it develops from here. The bears tend to place too much focus on Apple&#039;s valuation and fail to recognize that this is a stock that is often viewed as a place to park cash when market conditions become more difficult.

European markets are mixed in midday trading and U.S. equity futures point to a positive market open later this morning led by post-earnings gains in Amazon (AMZN) shares, which account for 3.0% of the S&amp;P 500 and 5.1% of the Nasdaq-100. Before the market opens, investors will be reviewing another key piece of July economic data, looking for further support for the soft-landing narrative that has been driving the market. Amid growing optimism about the economic outlook, this week Bank of America (BAC) became the first large Wall Street bank to officially reverse its call for a recession. At 8:30 AM ET, the Labor Department will release the July Employment Report, which is expected to show nonfarm payrolls grew by 200,000 during the month after adding 209,000 in the prior one. Wage data in the report is expected to show average hourly earnings up 4.2%, down from 4.4% the prior three months. Following the upside surprise in ADP’s July National Employment Report on Wednesday, stronger than anticipated data in the Employment Report may push back on the market’s view the Fed’s July rate hike was its last. To the extent the economy is stronger than previously thought we could see renewed questions as to when the Fed may deliver its first rate cut. As of now, data from the CME FedWatch Tool puts that timing between the Fed’s March and May 2024 policy meetings. Data Download International Economy Factory orders in Germany unexpectedly rose by 7% month-over-month in June, easily exceeding market estimates of a 2% fall and accelerating from the downwardly revised +6.2% figure in May. Retail sales in the Euro Area went down 0.3% MoM in June after a revised +0.6% in May, missing the market consensus forecast for +0.2%. On a YoY basis, June retail sales in the Euro Area fell 1.4%, better than the expected reading of -1.7% and May’s -2.4%. Ahead of OPEC+ ministers meeting today to review the oil market, Saudi Arabia said it will extend a voluntary oil output cut of one million barrels per day (bpd) for a third month to include September, adding it could be extended beyond that or deepened. Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said Russia would cut oil exports by 300,000 bpd in September. Domestic Economy As we laid about above, market watchers will be focused on this morning’s July Employment report, noting the pace of job creation during the month but also wage inflation and what that could mean for Fed monetary policy expectations. Markets Stocks continued to trade off yesterday although not as aggressively as Wednesday as Treasury yields ticked higher. The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.10%, the Dow gave back 0.19%, the S&amp;P 500 slid 0.25% and the Russell 2000 closed 0.28% lower. Sectors were mostly lower with Utilities taking the biggest lump, down 2.28% followed by Real Estate which fell 1.37%. While the U.S. credit downgrade had some impact on sentiment, concerns about China&#039;s weakness and mixed forward guidance this earning season is starting to creep into the near-term outlook. Energy was the only bright spot as the sector rallied 1.01% on oil prices firming at $80 per barrel.

The MSCI All-World index .MIWD00000PUS was flat on the day at 1123 GMT and headed for its biggest weekly drop in five months, thanks in part to a surge in government bond yields this week after more data pointed to slowing inflation and the prospect of a deluge of U.S. Treasury supply. Investor attention will be squarely on the July U.S. non-farm payrolls report, with a Reuters survey of 80 economists expecting payrolls to have increased by 200,000 last month, after rising 209,000 in June. Economists who have long been forecasting a downturn by the fourth quarter of this year are increasingly becoming convinced that the \"soft-landing\" scenario for the economy envisaged by the U.S. Federal Reserve is now possible. \"Today’s U.S. payrolls data is likely to continue to showcase the resilience of the U.S. economy,\" Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said in a note. Data showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit rose slightly last week, while layoffs dropped to an 11-month low in July as labour market conditions remained tight. The STOXX 600 was down 0.3% on the day .STOXX, while London&#039;s FTSE 100 .FTSE and Germany&#039;s DAX were both down 0.4% .GDAXI. Futures on the S&amp;P 500 EScv1 and on the Nasdaq 100 NQc1 both gained 0.2%, suggesting earnings from technology bellwethers could give the index a boost later on. Amazon AMZN.Oreported sales growth and profit that beat analyst estimates, while Apple AAPL.Oforecast a sales slump to continue into the current quarter. The benchmark indices closed little changed the previous day after a choppy trading session, as investors weighed up the implications of rising Treasury yields along with the latest batch of economic data and earnings. \"It’s a very fragile market,\" said Francesco Sandrini, head of multi-asset strategy at Amundi. \"The market is quite nervous at the moment, the very low volatility that has been prevailing so far now is facing a reality check.\" The dollar meanwhile rose 0.1% against a basket of major currencies =USD, heading for its third weekly gain in a row. It has made the most headway against some of this year&#039;s better-performing currencies, such as the Australian dollar AUD=D3, which lost 1.5% this week, or the poundGBP=D3, which is heading for a drop of 1.2% after the Bank of England delivered a smaller rate rise than many had hoped for. China&#039;s yuan CNH=D3, which is set for a 0.6% loss this week against the dollar, gained some respite after an official said on Friday the central bank would use policy tools flexibly to ensure reasonably ample liquidity in the banking system. Investors have been hoping policymakers will deliver more broad-based stimulus to boost the post-pandemic recovery as the world&#039;s second-largest economy struggles with weak demand at home and abroad. Further support for the U.S. dollar came from the Treasury market, where 10-year yields US10YT=RR held steady around nine-month highs, at 4.19%, while 30-year bond yields hovered at 4.28% US30YT=RR, set for their biggest weekly rise this year. Rating agency Fitch this week surprised markets by stripping the United States of its prized triple-A credit rating and cited the country&#039;s deteriorating fiscal position as one of the key drivers, thrusting the government&#039;s finances into the spotlight. Earlier in the week, the U.S. Treasury said it expects to borrow just over $1 trillion in the third quarter of this year alone, $273 billion more than its May estimate. Oil prices headed for a sixth straight weekly gain, driven up by the prospect of reduced supply from Saudi Arabia and Russia. U.S. crude CLc1 rose 0.3% to $81.81 a barrel, while Brent LCOc1 rose 0.4% to $85.44.

Laptop makers were expecting some government measures to reduce reliance on imports and promote local production, but the sudden imposition of licensing requirements has disrupted the industry, Bloomberg reports.Tech firms are now engaging with New Delhi to quickly obtain licenses, especially with the Diwali shopping season and the back-to-school period approaching. The ban has added challenges for manufacturers already facing a global glut of inventory and sluggish sales growth triggers.

The company IEP, -23.23% made the announcement as it reported a surprise quarterly loss with Chairman Carl Icahn, the billionaire activist investor, blaming the news squarely on one thing. “I believe the second quarter partially reflected the impact of short selling on companies we control or invest in, which I attribute to the misleading and self-serving Hindenburg report concerning our company, “Icahn said in a statement. “It also reflected the size of the hedge book relative to our activist strategy.” Icahn was referring to a report by short seller Hindenburg Research published on May 2 that accused IEP, Icahn’s publicly traded investing arm, of overstating asset values. Hindenburg also revealed that Icahn himself had borrowed from the company, among other issues. That had been disclosed in a footnote to financials that Wall Street had overlooked. Read: What we know about Carl Icahn’s margin loan See also: Carl Icahn rebuts short seller Hindenburg Research’s report. It’s already cost his company $6 billion in market cap. The report shaved billions off IEP’s market cap and was firmly rebutted by Icahn, who recently said he has finalized amended loan agreements with banks that untie his personal loans from the trading price of his company’s shares. Icahn said IEP has paid out distributions for 73 continuous quarters and does not intend for a “misleading” report to interfere with that practice. “The payment of future distributions will be determined by the board of directors quarterly, based upon current economic conditions and business performance and other factors that it deems relevant at the time that declaration of a distribution is considered,” said Icahn. On a call with analysts, IEP’s Chief Executive David Willetts highlighted the long-term “lumpiness” of the business, given its many moving parts. “We have large wins at times and we have volatility, we’re not a company that necessarily has predictable cash flow, there are no guarantees,” he told analysts. But IEP is not changing its strategy on distributions, he added. The stock was headed for the biggest one-day selloff since it went public 36 years ago. The next biggest drop was 20.0% on May 2, when the Hindenburg Research report was released. The company, which is 84% owned by Icahn and his son, Brett, offers exposure to Icahn’s personal portfolio of public and private companies, including petroleum refineries, car-parts makers, food-packaging companies and real estate. Its unit holders are mostly retail investors. The fund has performed poorly in the past decade. For many years Icahn has publicly expressed suspicion of the bull market that raged around him. He shorted the stock market in a big way as a hedge against his long activist positions. Going into 2021, for example, Icahn’s investment fund had a short exposure of 142%, SEC filings show. For more, see: Carl Icahn admits he was wrong to take a huge short position on the market that lost $9 billion Hindenburg, the short selling firm founded by Nate Anderson, took a victory lap on Elon Musk’s X platform, the renamed Twitter, noting that it had predicted that IEP’s poor investment performance would eventually force it to cut the distribution. Icahn has himself waged endless activist campaigns against companies and their management teams, and most recently succeeded in his effort to shake up management at gene sequencing test maker Illumina Inc. ILMN, +1.26% In June, that company accepted the resignation of its Chief Executive and director, Francis DeSouza, ending a monthslong heated battle over its $7.1 billion acquisition of cancer test maker Grail that has faced regulatory hurdles, as the Associated Press reported. Icahn had urged shareholders to vote out its chairman, John Thompson, and DeSouza. Company shareholders voted out Thompson in late May. Past activist campaigns by Icahn’s company have generated billions of dollars for shareholders and helped boards and CEOs capture untapped value, Icahn has argued, citing Reynolds, Netflix NFLX, +0.14% , Forest Labs, Apple AAPL, -4.80% , CVR Energy CVI, -0.98% , Herbalife eBay , Tropicana, Cheniere LNG, -0.95% and Occidental OXY, +2.11% as examples. IEP said it had a loss of $269 million, or 72 cents per depositary unit, for the second quarter, wider than the loss of $128 million, or 41 cents per depositary unit, posted in the year-earlier period. Revenue fell to $2.684 billion from $3.796 billion. The FactSet consensus was for income of 25 cents per depositary unit and revenue of $2.657 billion. Meanwhile, investors are waiting to see the outcome and other issues, which was disclosed along with first-quarter earnings. IEP’s stock is down 35% in the year to date, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX has gained 18%.\n\n---\n\n[2023-08-04] 2023-08-04 12:17:05\n标题: Qualcomm, NXP, others working on alternative Arm technology\n内容: Justin Sullivan Amid a legal dispute between Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBY)-owned Arm, the San Diego-based chipmaker is working with other companies on an alternative to Arm&#039;s technology. Led by CEO Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm (QCOM) is working with NXP Semiconductor (NASDAQ:NXPI), Nordic Semiconductor, Infineon Technologies () () and Robert Bosch to develop and promote the RISC-V architecture for design, according to a statement. Arm technology, licensed by companies such as Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and others, has dominated the mobile phone space and as increasingly moving into other areas, such as data centers and servers, where Intel (INTC) has long played. In the statement, Qualcomm (QCOM) senior vice president of product management Ziad Asghar said the company is excited to drive the RISC-V ecosystem expansion. \"Qualcomm Technologies has been investing in RISC-V for more than five years and we&#039;ve integrated RISC-V micro-controllers into many of our commercial platforms,\" Asghar said. \"We believe RISC-V&#039;s open-source instruction set will increase innovation and has the potential to transform the industry.\" The companies will initially go after the automotive market, but will expand beyond that into areas such as mobile and internet of things. San Diego, California-based Qualcomm (QCOM) and Arm are entrenched in a legal battle over its 2021 acquisition of chip start-up Nuvia. Qualcomm (QCOM) is working on a Nuvia-inspired chip, which uses Arm technology, that it wants to use for laptops. However, Arm said Qualcomm (QCOM) needs a new license to use Nuvia&#039;s designs, while Qualcomm said it already has a license for Arm chip design that is wider reaching than the previous Nuvia license. Arm is slated to go public later this year and is reportedly targeting a valuation of as much as $60B in the initial public offering.

Gross margin of 44.5% topped Refinitiv’s 44.2% estimate.iPhones brought in $39.67 billion to the revenue table, below Refinitiv’s consensus estimate of $39.91 billion as iPhone sales contracted 2%.Mac revenue was down 7% as it amounted to $6.84 billion, surpassing Refinitiv’s consensus estimate of $6.62 billion.iPad revenue contracted as much as 20% as it amounted to $5.79 billion, far below Refinitiv’s $6.41 billion consensus estimate.Other Products revenue that includes wearables such as Apple Watch and AirPods rose 2% as it brought in $8.28 billion, but coming in below the estimated $8.39 billion.Last but certainly not least, service revenue that was also the highlight of the report, rose 8% YoY to $21.21 billion, topping the estimated $20.76 billion. Apple is said to now have 1 billion subscribers on its platform, which includes both Apple services and third-party apps, rising from 975 million subscribers it reported for the previous quarter.Like its Big Tech peers, Apple ramped up its AI spending, with research and development costs coming up to $22.61 billion for the fiscal year so far, which is $3.12 billion higher compared to last year’s comparable period. But, AI is still not showing any visible gains, but this is even the case for Amazon and its AWS unit as both companies continue experimenting with ways in which this developing technology can enhance their products and consumer experiences.Beating The Odds In ChinaApple’s sales in China grew 8% YoY and what is interesting is that Apple seems to have outperformed what has been the weakest smartphone market in the country in almost a decade. Counterpoint Research reported that overall smartphone sales in the country contracted 8% but Apple CEO Tim Cook informed investors that iPhone sales in China grew by \"double digits” with other segments also reporting high sales. Apple got $15.76 billion in revenue from the greater China region with sales expanding from $14.60 billion recorded during last year’s comparable quarter, it generated. Besides new iPhone owners, Cook also revealed the company set quarterly records wearables, home and accessories, and services in the world&#039;s greatest market.Official Outlook Was AbsentAlthough an official guidance was not given due to macroeconomic uncertainty, the tech giant reflected on its views for the undergoing quarter with only the gross margin being said to be expected between 44 and 45% with OpEx in the range from $13.5 and $13.7 billion. CFO Luca Maestri said the September quarter revenue is expected to decline with performance anticipated to be similar to the June quarter. This implies that the sales forecast falls below analyst expectations of roughly flat fiscal fourth-quarter sales of $90.19 billion that Refinitiv’s survey of analysts were expecting. iPads and Macs revenue is expected to drop by double-digit percentages but iPhone sales are expected to do better and the already strong growth rate of Apple’s Services unit is expected to rise further. Therefore, the unofficial outlook can be summed up as similar to the latest reported quarter, but hopefully slightly better.Apple Finds Itself In A Delicate PositionApple will continue facing the struggling smartphone market with iPhone having to fight for market share against its Android rivals, while its next big product that is expected to push the boundaries of its existing business model, Vision Pro mixed-reality headset, still hasn’t reached consumers. Therefore, the world is waiting to see Apple’s new way of ‘enriching’ the lives of its consumers while Big Tech enters a new chapter, one that will undoubtedly be powered by generative AI.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Under his leadership, Berkshire Hathaway stock compounded at 20% annually for nearly six decades, growing twice as fast as the S&amp;P 500. Very few companies ever achieve that rate of success, and much of the credit goes to Buffett and his ability to identify rewarding investments. Indeed, Buffett engineered dozens of savvy acquisitions over the years, and he helped Berkshire build a $328 billion equity investment portfolio. But investors may be surprised to learn that a single stock accounts for 46% of that total. Berkshire had $151 billion invested in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) as of the March quarter. Apple is one of seven companies that have recently been dubbed the \"Magnificent Seven\" by Wall Street. The others are listed below: Microsoft Alphabet Amazon Nvidia Tesla Meta Platforms The truly magnificent thing about the Magnificent Seven is the wealth they have created for shareholders. Those seven companies are collectively worth more than $11 trillion, and Apple is the largest of the bunch with a market cap of $3 trillion. Yet, Berkshire has never sold a single share of Apple stock, implying that the company and Buffett see plenty of upside still to come. Apple reported mixed results in the third quarter Apple delivered better-than-expected financial results for the fiscal third quarter (ended July 1), but its performance was far from extraordinary. Total revenue decreased 1.4% year over year to $81.8 billion, the third consecutive year-over-year decline in quarterly revenue, as weakness in the iPhone, Mac, and iPad segments more than offset strength in the services segment. On the bright side, Apple continued to become more profitable. While revenue declined, gross profit increased 1.5% year over year to $36.4 billion as high-margin services accounted for a large chunk of total sales. That margin expansion trickled down to the bottom line, where GAAP net income climbed 2.3% to $19.9 billion. But earnings actually jumped 5% to $1.26 per diluted share as the company continued to buy back stock. Image source: The Motley Fool. Looking ahead, management expects sales in the iPhone and services segments to accelerate in the fiscal fourth quarter. Apple has a durable competitive advantage Warren Buffett sees a sustainable competitive advantage as the most important quality any business can possess. Competitive advantages come in different shapes and sizes, but they generally boil down to pricing power. A business that can raise prices without losing market share to the competition is a good business, according to Buffett, and he believes Apple has pricing power in spades. Buffett made his point in a CNBC interview earlier this year: \"If you&#039;re an Apple user and somebody offers you $10,000, but the only proviso is they&#039;ll take away your iPhone and you&#039;ll never be able to buy another, you&#039;re not going to take it,\" he said. Very few companies inspire that type of consumer loyalty or possess that kind of pricing power, but Apple is no ordinary company. The investment thesis for Apple The Apple brand is synonymous with premium devices, and the company enjoys a strong market presence in several consumer electronics verticals, including a leadership position in smartwatches and tablets. But the iPhone is the real breadwinner. Apple is the second-largest smartphone manufacturer in the world, and its market share has climbed 700 basis points to 17% over the last four years, while Samsung has only managed to tread water at 22%. That puts Apple in a good spot. The global smartphone market is expected to increase at 6.8% annually through 2030. However, the company has more exciting growth opportunities on the services side of its business, where Apple monetizes its installed base of 2 billion active devices with higher-margin products like cloud storage, mobile app store content, streaming media, and financial services. Apple has a particularly strong foothold in two of those markets. The Apple App Store earns twice as much revenue as its closest competitor, and Apple Pay is nearly three times as popular among U.S. consumers as the next closest in-store mobile wallet. That puts the company in a good position. The global mobile app market is expected to grow at 13.8% annually through 2030, and the U.S. mobile wallet market is expected to grow at 26.7% annually over the same period. Is Apple stock worth buying? Given the industry forecasts, investors can reasonably expect Apple to grow hardware revenue and services revenue in the mid-single digits and low double-digits, respectively, through the end of the decade. That gives Apple a good shot at growing total revenue between 6% and 9% annually over the same period. However, its bottom line should grow more quickly because services revenue earns higher margins and the company consistently repurchases shares. Accounting for that, Apple has a good shot at growing earnings per share between 10% and 15% annually through 2030. With that in mind, Apple stock currently trades at 32 times earnings, a premium to its three-year average of 24.7 times earnings. I question whether Apple can deliver market-beating returns over the next five to 10 years starting from that valuation, but Buffett evidently thinks otherwise. Investors eager to own this stock should start with a very small position. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

About half of the company&#039;s overall revenue comes from its iPhone segment. On Friday, Apple stock was down more than 2.5% in premarket trading, as the tech giants gloomy results contributed to it&#039;s share price decline. Revenue has slid for multiple quarters at the tech giant as Mac and iPad sales have flagged. On a call with analysts Apple CFO Luca Maestri said the company expects revenue for these products to fall by double digits from last year, citing pent-up demand from the prior year quarter after factory shutdowns. Services was a bright spot for Apple, rising a faster-than-expected 8% from the year-ago period to an all-time high for the segment. The company also beat expectations for overall revenue and earnings per share. Here’s some of Apple’s most significant metrics compared to what Wall Street was expecting in the company’s fiscal third quarter, according to data from Bloomberg: Revenue: $81.80 billion versus $81.55 billion expected ($82.96 billion in Q3 2022) Adj. EPS: $1.26 versus $1.20 expected ($1.20 in Q3 2022) iPhone revenue: $39.67 billion versus $39.79 billion expected ($40.67 billion in Q3 2022) Services revenue: $21.21 billion versus $20.77 billion expected ($19.60 billion in Q3 2022) Mac revenue: $6.84 billion versus $6.37 billion expected ($7.38 billion in Q3 2022) iPad revenue: $5.79 billion versus $6.33 billion expected ($7.22 billion in Q3 2022) Wearables revenue: $8.28 billion versus $8.38 billion expected ($8.08 billion in Q3 2022) Apple CEO Tim Cook holds one of the company&#039;s new MacBooks on the Apple campus Monday, June 5, 2023, in Cupertino, Calif. (Jeff Chiu/AP Photo) The quarterly report arrived just weeks ahead of Apple’s new hardware lineup, including the iPhone 15 and its next slate of smartwatches. \"We expect our September quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the June quarter, assuming that the macroeconomic outlook doesn&#039;t worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter,\" said CFO Luca Maestri. Story continues Maestri told analysts that the company expects revenue for iPhone and services to accelerate, while Mac and iPad are expected to decline by double digits \"due to difficult compares.\" The company experienced a slight acceleration of performance in the Americas, Maestri said, but flagged in the US, \"because the [US] smartphone market has been in a decline for the last couple of quarters.\" During the call Cook once again emphasized Apple&#039;s success in emerging markets. Revenue reached new highs in multiple countries, including India and Indonesia, Cook said. Cook noted an acceleration in China, but different consumer behavior stateside. \"It&#039;s a challenging smartphone market in the US currently,\" he said. Apple touted its install base of 2 billion active devices. “We are happy to report that we had an all-time revenue record in Services during the June quarter, driven by over 1 billion paid subscriptions, and we saw continued strength in emerging markets thanks to robust sales of iPhone,” Cook said in a statement. Apple&#039;s earnings, which arrived alongside Amazon&#039;s results on Thursday, round out the quarterly reports from the major tech companies, which featured better-than-expected results from Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and a revenue miss from Microsoft last week. The tech sector has surged this year, riding optimism on cutting-edge AI technology, the resiliency of online advertising, and growth in cloud services. After wrapping up July, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) won its fifth straight month of gains, and is up almost 40% for the year.

        "title": "What To Expect From Apple's Q3 Results?",
        "content": "<p>Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to publish its Q3 FY’23 results in early August, reporting on another quarter that is likely to see Apple’s key computing products face sluggish demand. We expect earnings to stand at about $1.07 per share, slightly below consensus estimates. On the other hand, we expect revenues to come in about $74 billion, marking a decline of about 11% versus last year and marginally ahead of consensus estimates. So what are some of the trends that are likely to drive Apple’s results for the quarter? See our analysis on Apple Earnings Preview for a closer look at what to expect when Apple publishes earnings. While Q3 is typically a seasonally weak quarter for Apple, we expect sales of products such as the Mac and iPad to also decline year-over-year, as the remote working trend eases and the broader PC and tablet markets cool. For perspective, over Q2 FY’23, Apple’s Mac sales declined by about 31% year-over-year. However, sales of the iPhone could prove a bit more resilient, given the traction that Apple is seeing in markets such as India, Indonesia, and Turkey where installment plans and trade-in programs are helping drive demand. Apple’s digital services business should partly help Apple ride out the lull in its hardware business driven by higher sales at the AppStore and improving the uptake of other subscription services. However, growth rates are likely to remain below the levels seen last year. That said, it is likely that Apple will continue to expand its gross margins for the quarter driven by a higher mix of service sales, more premium products, and also due to some cost savings. While Apple stock could move higher if it beats earnings, we believe that the stock is overvalued at current levels of about $195 per share. Apple currently trades at over 35x forward earnings, which is high relative to historical levels. Moreover, Apple’s earnings are poised to contract this year per consensus estimates, with revenue growth projected to remain slow over the next year as well. We value Apple at about $162 per share, about 17% below the market price. See our analysis of Apple Valuation for more details on what’s driving our price estimate for Apple and how it compares with peers.

        "title": "As Disney Leads the Week in Unusual Options Flow, NVDA, AAPL, XPEV Follow",
        "content": "<p>Many investors brush off or ignore options trading because options are complex and misunderstood. However, many other traders have learned how to “follow the flow.” In other words, they want to know what the big funds and institutions are doing. When these buyers make their move in the options world, they leave a trail behind them -- footsteps in the data. We can follow those footsteps when looking for unusual options activity. Our guide is Fintel’s leaderboard of options activity, showing the action in both calls and puts, helping us keep track of it all when we see outsized volume. Let’s look at some of the most interesting action of the past week. Disney (DIS) Coming in at Number 1 on our Options Flow Leaderboard is Disney (US:DIS), which is interesting given that the stock continues to dip to 52-week lows. While $87.01 was the prior 52-week low from May, DIS stock has now closed below that mark in seven of the last nine sessions. That’s as shares are down about 57.5% from the all-time high, which was made in November 2021. Despite the clearly bearish price action, options investors seem torn on the stock’s trajectory. On July 27, there were two notable put trades that went through on the long side -- indicating a bearish position. That’s as someone bought $35.77 million of the January 2024 $160 puts and $3.69 million of the September $110 puts. There was also a $3.44 million sale of the January 2024 $120 puts tied to the same trade. All of these puts were deep-in-the-money as shares were trading near $85.50 at the time of the trade. The January 2024 $160 put was active on July 26, too. That’s as someone paid $37.14 million in premium for this particular put option, but then about 15 minutes later, another trade hit the tape. This time a $108.48 million sale of the January 2024 $160 puts. It coincided with a $10.68 million sale of the September $110 puts (the same strike traded that was pointed out above). Later, another $38.86 million of the January $160 puts were sold, so the trader in this name was quite large and quite active. Apple (AAPL) As the biggest stock in the world is gearing up to report earnings on Aug. 3, it’s not surprising to see Apple (US:AAPL) on our list at Number 2. Given that it’s Apple, there were plenty of low-seven-figure options trades placed over the last few days. However, two trades really stand out. The first came on July 24, as someone bought $38.9 million of the January $175 calls in three separate trades each about five minutes apart. These calls were in-the-money by almost $20 a share at the time of the trade. The second trade on AAPL stock options was a much deeper in-the-money position. That’s as someone bought $4.53 million of the June 2024 $110 calls on July 28. A few minutes later, they bought another $4.53 million worth of the same calls. Lucid Motors (LCID) Lucid Motors (US:LCID) lit up the options leaderboard during the week ending July 21 and traders were back at it last week, too. There was plenty of options flow that stood out — like when one trader scooped up $426,700 worth of the September $8 calls. However, one trade in particular really stood out. That trade came on July 26, the same day as the trade noted above, but this one was significantly larger. That’s as one trader sold $5.57 million worth of the January 2024 $47 puts and $5.22 million worth of the $37 puts of the same expiration. Notably, these LCID stock options were deep-in-the-money, with shares trading near $7.10 at the time of the trade. Perhaps it was investors&#039; way of speculating on electric vehicle stocks, as XPeng (US:XPEV) has caught fire this week… Xpeng (XPEV) Speaking of XPeng, the stock has been downright explosive. There are two factors in play here. First, Chinese EV stocks started the week with a bang on news of Chinese stimulus being put to work to help give the economy a boost. Second, Volkswagen took a stake in XPeng with a $700 million investment on Wednesday. Shares are up 60.5% this week alone, as XPEV stock works on its fourth weekly rally in the last five weeks. In that span, shares are up 130%. Interestingly, there were not a lot of trades that stood out specifically. However, one option was red hot, that being the $16 calls that expire on August 11th. Shortly after the session open, someone bought over $935,000 of these calls. Then, 10 minutes later, they bought another $960,000 of these calls. For what it’s worth, the August $20 calls were also quite active on the long side. Snap (SNAP) Snap (US:SNAP) reported earnings earlier this week, falling 14.2% on July 26 as a result. There was some pretty bullish flow going into the report, perhaps most notably the $7.7 million one trader spent on the August $14 calls. The calls were slightly out-of-the-money, with shares trading near $12.60 at the time. Obviously with the stock’s post-earnings decline though, these calls have been crushed. On the flip side, less than an hour before the close on July 25 -- so just before the company reported earnings -- someone sold $1.11 million of the August $13.50 calls. Nvidia (NVDA) Given the rise of AI stocks and semiconductor stocks, Nvidia (US:NVDA) has been at the forefront of the market surge. Despite NVDA stock trading pretty well this week -- up in four out of five trading days this week -- the bear flow was evident. There was quite a bit of low-seven-figure call sales, which is neutral at best but tends to lean bearish. Two directional trades that stood out were clear. That’s as one trader bought $6.53 million of the June 2025 at-the-money $440 calls on July 24, which expire in almost two years. The other came a day later on a $4.53 million purchase of the September at-the-money $460 puts. One other trade stood out, which came on July 26 as someone sold $24.97 million of the July 28 $510 puts and bought $24.94 million of the July 29 $505 puts. In other words, they sold the $510/$505 put spread, which was deep-in-the-money by about $50 a share and expired in just two days. This story originally appeared on Fintel.

        "content": "<p>Chicago, IL – July 31, 2023 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Starbucks SBUX, and Uber UBER. Green Shoots Emerging from the Earnings Landscape With a little over half of June-quarter results already out, we can confidently call the overall earnings picture reassuringly stable and resilient. Earnings aren&#039;t great, but no one expected them to be so. Instead, many in the market feared a material deterioration in the outlook that would show up in negative guidance and lowered estimates. While we have seen a few reports with downbeat guidance, the overall tone and substance of guidance and management commentary have been favorable. The net effect of this is a very stable earnings outlook, even though estimates in the aggregate are still coming down due to a weakening revisions trend for the Energy sector. You can see this by comparing earnings estimates for 2023 Q3 as well as full-year 2023 today to where they stood at the start of July and April. The expectation today is for 2023 Q3 earnings to be down -2.1% from the same period last year on +0.2% higher revenues. If we exclude the Energy sector, Q3 earnings would be up +3.3% on +3% higher revenues. One month ago, on June 27th, the expectation was for Q3 earnings to be down -1.4% on +0.7% higher revenues. Q3 earnings were expected to be up +3.4% on an ex-Energy basis on June 27th. Four months back, on March 29th, the expectation was for Q3 earnings to be up +0.6% on +0.7% higher revenues. Q3 earnings were expected to be up +4.4% on an ex-Energy basis on March 29th. This discussion of evolving aggregate Q3 earnings estimates reflects that while analysts have cut their estimates for the period, a big part of the negative revisions is due to the Energy sector. While estimates in the aggregate for the remaining 15 sectors of the S&amp;P 500 index are essentially unchanged over the past month, there are plenty of cross-currents at the individual sector levels. Specifically, estimates for the Tech, Construction, Autos, Transportation, and Utilities sectors have increased while the same for the other sectors have modestly come down. Regular readers of our earnings commentary would be familiar with these revisions trends, as we have been flagging them since the start of 2023 Q2. We noticed a significant stabilization in the revisions trend since the beginning of April, which was in contrast to the persistently negative revisions trend that had been in place for about a year prior. Q2 is on track to be the third consecutive quarter of earnings declines and the first quarter of declining revenues. As noted earlier, a big part of the earnings and revenue weakness is due to the Energy sector. Excluding the Energy sector drag, Q2 earnings would be down -2.9% on +3.6% higher revenues. 2023 Q2 will be the 6th consecutive quarter of declining margins for the S&amp;P 500 index. Margins in Q2 are expected to be below the year-earlier level for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest margin pressure expected to be in the Energy, Medical, Basic Materials, and Construction sectors. With the earnings focus lately on the Tech sector, it is instructive to see how much distance has been covered on the margins front in this vital sector. On the positive side, margins are on track to be above the year-earlier level for six sectors, with notable gains in the Consumer Discretionary, Finance, and Transportation sectors. As noted earlier, the estimate revisions trend has notably stabilized since the start of Q2. In the aggregate, S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates for 2023 have declined -1.6% since the beginning of April but only -0.5% on an ex-Energy basis. Importantly, estimates for sectors like Tech, Construction, Autos, and Transportation have increased in that timeframe. We see this favorable turn in the revisions trend as green shoots in the overall earnings landscape and indicative of better days ahead. Q2 Earnings Scorecard As of Friday, July 28th, the Q2 earnings season crossed the halfway mark, with results from 254 S&amp;P 500 members already out. We have a full reporting docket this upcoming week, with more than 1100 companies reporting results, including 169 S&amp;P 500 members. By the end of this week, we will have seen Q2 results from almost 85% of the index members. The notable companies reporting this week include Apple, Amazon, Starbucks, Uber and others. Apple&#039;s Q2 earnings are expected to be -4.1% below the year-earlier level on -2% lower revenues. The stock has been a standout performer this year, up +50.1% vs. +19.4% for the S&amp;P 500 index. It has been a while since Apple shares were down following a quarterly release. In fact, the last time the stock reacted negatively to a quarterly release was two years ago, in July 2021. Uber, which reports before the market&#039;s open on Tuesday, August 1st, has done even better than Apple this year, up +95.6% in the year-to-date period. This is expected to be a milestone quarter for Uber, with the current consensus EPS estimate at breakeven, up from the year-earlier period&#039;s -$1.33 loss. Total Q2 earnings for the 254 S&amp;P 500 members are down -3.4% from the same period last year on +1.7% higher revenues, with 80.3% beating EPS estimates and 64.6% beating revenue estimates. The Apple release after the market&#039;s close on Thursday, August 3rd, will keep the Tech sector in focus this week as well. Through Friday, July 28th, we have seen Q2 results from 52% of the sector&#039;s total market capitalization in the index. Total earnings for these Tech companies are up +0.4% from the same period last year on +1.5% higher revenues, with 93.8% beating EPS estimates and 75% beating revenue estimates.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)  Getty Images    </div> <p> Apple’s third-quarter report on Thursday is set to be the highlight of a busy earnings week. Optimism could be dented if the tech giant warns about a tough smartphone market when it updates on outlook, but analysts at Piper Sandler and Wedbush recommend investors look past that and back the stock to go higher. </p> <p> Apple (ticker: APPL) is dealing with a slowdown in smartphone sales along with the rest of the sector. </p> <div> <p>Consensus forecasts are for Apple to generate $40.23 billion in revenue from iPhone sales in the June quarter, falling from $51.33 billion in the preceding quarter. </p> <p>Analysts at Piper Sandler wrote in a research note on Monday that they expect Apple to deliver on expectations for the June quarter and, more importantly, offer a September quarter forecast that will match or slightly exceed Wall Street consensus expectations. </p> <p>“In our conversations, most investors feel that a soft China could pose a risk to the numbers and further commentary, but we feel that Apple’s position in China is on a solid footing and that the company is likely to see only a small if any decline in its iPhone sales,” wrote Piper Sandler’s Harsh Kumar. </p> <p>Kumar pushed his target price on Apple up to $220 from $180, reiterating an Overweight rating on the stock. </p> <p>Apple shares were up 0.2% in premarket trading at $196.16, having risen 51% this year so far as of last Friday’s close.</p> <p>Wedbush’s Daniel Ives also said forecasts for a significant downturn in iPhone sales could prove to be unduly pessimistic. </p> <p>“We believe Apple should post at least in-line June quarter iPhone revenue with upside likely when the company reports this Thursday after the bell,” Ives wrote. </p> <p>Ives said the potential upside surprise could come from gaining market share in China, while holding steady in the U.S. and Europe. However, he warns that Apple could give a muted outlook for the current quarter. </p> <div></div> <p>“We would expect relatively conservative September guidance as this is all about the drumroll to the main event with the anniversary iPhone 15 launch slated for the mid September time frame,” Ives wrote. </p> <p>Overall though, Ives suggests backing the $3 trillion stock on a likely acceleration in services revenue in 2024. Based on adding another 100 million iPhone users in the past 18 months, plus price increases and improving activity on the App Store, he expects the services business to accelerate to double-digit growth in the coming quarters. </p> <p>“We believe the Services business is worth $1.3 trillion to $1.4 trillion for Apple’s sum-of-the parts valuation and remains an underappreciated asset by the Street with many naysayers still not believers in the “new Apple valuation” reset in motion,” Ives wrote. </p> <p>Ives kept a Buy rating and $220 target price on Apple stock. </p> <p>Write to Adam Clark at </p> </div></p>"

        "title": "Option Volatility and Earnings Report for July 31 – August 4",
        "content": "<p>Last week was busy on the earnings front, but we have even more companies reporting this week including Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Uber (UBER), PayPal (PYPL), Pfizer (PFE), Coinbase (COIN) and Robinhood (HOOD) all set to report. Before a company reports earnings, implied volatility is usually high because the market is unsure about the outcome of the report. Speculators and hedgers create huge demand for the company’s options which increases the implied volatility, and therefore, the price of options. After the earnings announcement, implied volatility usually drops back down to normal levels. Let’s take a look at the expected range for these stocks. To calculate the expected range, look up the option chain and add together the price of the at-the-money put option and the at-the-money call option. Use the first expiry date after the earnings date. While this approach is not as accurate as a detailed calculation, it does serve as a reasonably accurate estimate. Monday SOFI – 16.2% ANET – 8.3% Tuesday AMD – 7.8% PFE – 3.7% SBUX – 5.4% CAT – 4.4% MRK – 3.1% NCLH – 8.4% UBER – 8.4% DVN – 5.1% Wednesday CVS – 4.3% PYPL – 8.2% HUM – 4.9% SHOP – 10.6% OXY – 4.3% KHC – 3.0% HOOD – 10.4% ETSY – 11.3% Thursday AMZN – 6.6% AAPL – 3.5% BUD – 5.6% COIN – 11.9% SQ – 8.4% ABNB – 7.8% DKNG – 11.0% EXPE – 7.6% NET – 13.3% Friday NKLA – 28.0% ENB – 4.1% D – 4.3% Option traders can use these expected moves to structure trades. Bearish traders can look at selling bear call spreads outside the expected range. Bullish traders can sell bull put spreads outside the expected range, or look at naked puts for those with a higher risk tolerance. Neutral traders can look at iron condors. When trading iron condors over earnings, it is best to keep the short strikes outside the expected range. When trading options over earnings, it is best to stick to risk defined strategies and keep position size small. If the stock makes a larger than expected move and the trade suffers a full loss, it should not have more than a 1-3% effect on your portfolio.

        "content": "<p>By Johann M Cherian and Bansari Mayur Kamdar July 31 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures edged up on Monday with key benchmarks on track to end July higher, while investors awaited quarterly earnings from more megacap companies and a crucial employment report later this week. All three main U.S. indexes ended last week higher as signs of cooling inflation and a resilient economy cemented investor bets on a soft landing for the country. Upbeat quarterly earnings from megacap growth companies such as Alphabet GOOGL.O, Meta Platforms META.O as well as chipmakers Intel INTC.O and Lam Research LRCX.O have also boosted investor sentiment. Second-quarter earnings for S&amp;P 500 companies are now estimated to have fallen 6.4% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv data. While still negative, the forecast is an improvement from the 7.9% drop estimated a week ago. The blue-chip Dow .DJI logged its longest winning streak in nearly four-decades this month, underpinned by gains in sectors including healthcare, financials and energy that had underperformed during the first half of the year. \"Markets are growing increasingly confident that we are approaching the end of the current rate-hike cycle and that a soft landing can be delivered,\" said Joshua Warner, market analyst at City Index. \"However, the future path of interest rates and the outlook for earnings both remain at the behest of macroeconomic conditions and data will remain key.\" Investors will parse remarks by Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, due later in the day. Citigroup raised its 2023-end and mid-2024 S&amp;P 500 targets to 4,600 and 5,000, respectively, to reflect a higher possibility of a soft landing. The benchmark index closed at 4,582 on Friday. Investors await quarterly reports from Apple AAPL.O, Amazon.com AMZN.O and AMD AMD.O later this week, while July ISM Manufacturing reading and three sets of employment data, including July&#039;s non-farm payrolls are also in focus. At 07:00 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were up 44 points, or 0.12%, S&amp;P 500 e-minis EScv1 were up 4.5 points, or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were up 2.5 points, or 0.02%. Financial services provider SoFi Technologies SOFI.O gained 7.2% in premarket trading on reporting better-than-expected quarterly revenue. Chipmaker ON Semiconductor ON.O added 2.2% ahead of its second-quarter results. Johnson &amp; JohnsonJNJ.N shed 1.4% after a U.S. judge shot down the drugmaker&#039;s second attempt to resolve tens of thousands of lawsuits over its talc products. Salesforce CRM.N eased 1.7% after Morgan Stanley cut the business software provider&#039;s rating, while UPS UPS.N slid 1.3% on a downgrade from Credit Suisse.

        "title": "55% of Warren Buffett's $382 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in These 2 Stocks",
        "content": "<p>The period from 2010 to 2021 saw many growth stocks deliver mind-boggling gains, fueled by the availability of cheap capital. However, the landscape changed in 2022 with soaring inflation forcing the Federal Reserve to push up interest rates, which in turn increased the cost of capital. In response to this tough macro environment, investors are now increasingly prioritizing return-on-capital metrics and are shifting to Warren Buffett&#039;s time-tested investment strategy of buying high-quality stocks at an attractive price (value investing). Class A and B shares of Buffett&#039;s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway have gained 24.1% and 22.3%, respectively, in the past year. This is significantly more than the 15% rise recorded by the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index in the same time frame. Given this backdrop, let&#039;s assess whether Buffett&#039;s top two investments can prove to be good picks now. Apple Tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) accounts for 46.7% of Berkshire Hathaway&#039;s investment portfolio. This is not surprising considering Buffett and the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Charlie Munger, have a penchant for picking up stocks with a strong management and competitive advantage. Apple has managed to cultivate impressive customer loyalty and brand authority for its products (iPhone, iPad, and Mac). That&#039;s despite the ongoing contraction in the global smartphone market (which has lasted for two years. According to Counterpoint Research, Apple&#039;s iPhone ended the second quarter with a 17% share. Shipments of the iPhone have proven quite resilient, dropping by only 2% on a year-over-year basis, far lower than the 8% year-over-year drop in global smartphone shipments in the second quarter (due to a longer consumer replacement cycle and increasing demand for refurbished phones). While smartphone demand in lower and mid-tier segments has suffered, the premium segment has continued to grow. With iPhone firmly placed in the premium segment (smartphones costing $600 or more at wholesale), Apple has remained relatively immune to the headwinds in the broader smartphone market. Besides launching several generations of the iPhone, Apple has been committed to innovation in other products such as the iPad, Apple Watch, and MacBook. To further leverage its installed base of over 2 billion active devices, the company has also introduced a range of services such as iCloud storage, Apple Pay, Apple Music, Apple TV+, and the App Store. While these services do not bring high upfront payments (like devices do), they are helping the company build secure and recurring revenue streams with higher margins. This, in turn, is expected to make Apple less vulnerable to consumer slowdowns, while also increasing its bottom line. As per a Bloomberg report, Apple is also said to be making artificial intelligence tools to compete with OpenAI and Microsoft&#039;s ChatGPT, Alphabet&#039;s Google, and several others. In case these tools materialize, they will further contribute to the company&#039;s top line. The recent run-up in prices has made Apple&#039;s shares pretty expensive. The stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 33, significantly higher than the hardware industry median of 20.6. However, considering the company&#039;s solid long-term growth prospects, its share prices can continue to grow in the coming months. Hence, it makes sense for retail investors to pick up a small position in this stock even at current elevated levels. Bank of America The second-largest bank in the U.S. (by total assets), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) accounts for 8.7% of Berkshire Hathaway&#039;s investment portfolio. Despite the regional banking crisis, this Charlotte-based bank managed to surpass both consensus revenue and earnings estimates in the second quarter. In fact, CEO Brian Moynihan considers the second quarter to be one of the strongest quarters in the company&#039;s history. Bank of America reported an $18 billion drop in average deposits since the first quarter. While this may seem daunting, Bank of America&#039;s stellar balance sheet has helped build confidence among investors. The bank&#039;s common equity Tier 1 ratio (a risk-adjusted measure of financial strength) improved by 110 basis points year over year to 11.6%. The bank also has ample liquidity, as is evident from $867 billion in global liquidity sources. Thanks to the soaring inflation and subsequent interest rate hikes, Bank of America has seen impressive growth in net interest income (NII). With the Federal Reserve continuing its interest rate hike in July 2023, Bank of America may see even further growth in NII in the coming quarters. The bank also has managed to maintain the credit quality of its consumer and commercial portfolios despite the tough environment -- as is evident from the nearly stable and low percentage of nonperforming loans and leases in the second quarter. Bank of America has been long known for its solid dividend yield -- currently 2.96%. With that, plus its interest rate-sensitive business model, this banking giant may prove to be an attractive pick in the current macroeconomic environment. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "1 Warren Buffett Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist Right Now",
        "content": "<p>If you&#039;re looking for a stock that can deliver consistent growth and dividends, you might want to consider Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). The tech giant is the largest holding of Warren Buffett&#039;s Berkshire Hathaway, (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) accounting for a whopping 47% of its stock holdings at last count. Here are some of the factors that make Apple stock a compelling buy and hold right now. Strong financial performance Apple&#039;s financial performance has been impressive in recent quarters, despite the headwinds of high interest rates, unfavorable foreign exchange rates, supply chain disruptions, a slowing global economy, and geopolitical uncertainty. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, for example, Apple reported revenue of $94.8 billion. This figure does mark a 3% decrease from the same quarter a year ago, but Apple still returned a staggering $23 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends in the quarter. A business that can return that much cash to shareholders in a difficult operating environment is a model of success. Apple is also poised to benefit from the recovery of the global economy in 2024. Wall Street analysts project that the tech behemoth will grow its revenue by 6.7% in 2024. Mid-single-digit revenue growth is a remarkable achievement for a company with market value of over $3 trillion as of this writing. A loyal customer base One of the key advantages Apple has over its competitors is its extremely loyal customer base. According to a survey by SellCell, a platform for selling used phones and tablets, 92% of iPhone owners plan to stick with Apple the next time they upgrade their devices. This figure is notably higher than the loyalty rates for competitors such as Samsung (85.7%) and Alphabet (84%). Apple&#039;s loyal customers are willing not only to buy its hardware products but also its lineup of popular services, including Apple Pay and iTunes. That&#039;s great news, because Apple crossed the 2 billion active device user threshold last December. It thus has a huge customer base to leverage for its family of value-added services. Moreover, Apple&#039;s customer loyalty is likely to increase further with the introduction of new features and products that enhance its ecosystem. For instance, Apple recently launched the Vision Pro mixed-reality headset. While the Vision Pro is unlikely to be a major revenue driver because of its hefty price point, cutting-edge innovations like this one are likely to attract even more customers and subsequently bolster retention rates even further. A reasonable valuation and reliable dividend Despite its strong performance and growth prospects, Apple&#039;s stock is not overly expensive compared to its peers. At present, Apple&#039;s stock is trading at 29.6 times projected earnings. For comparison, Microsoft shares trade at over 30 times projected earnings, and Amazon shares exchange hands at over 82 times forward earnings. Apple&#039;s shares, in turn, are reasonably valued for a high-growth tech company. What&#039;s more, Apple stock offers a modest annualized dividend yield of 0.5% at current levels. While its dividend yield is below average for a large-cap company, its dividend is exceptionally well covered by earnings. Underscoring this point, Apple&#039;s trailing-12-month payout ratio of 15.5% is near rock bottom for a megacap company. Most of its peers, after all, sport payout ratios that consistently fall between 40% and 60%. Bottom line: The company should have no problem raising its dividend for the 12th consecutive year in the next fiscal period. The big picture Buffett is a big fan of Apple for a host of reasons. It has stellar financials, a loyal customer base, a reasonable valuation, and a well-supported dividend program. So if you&#039;re looking for a stock that can deliver long-term value and income, you might want to follow Buffett&#039;s lead and buy Apple hand over fist right now. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Factors to Note Ahead of NCR Corporation's (NCR) Q2 Earnings",
        "content": "<p>NCR Corporation NCR is set to report second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 2. For the second quarter of 2023, NCR projects revenues between $1.9 billion and $2 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.95 billion, suggesting a 2.3% increase from the year-ago period. The company forecasts a non-GAAP EPS in the band of 70-76 cents for the to-be-reported quarter. The consensus mark for earnings stands at 63 cents per share, 11.3% lower than the year-ago quarter. In the last reported quarter, NCR delivered outstanding results, with strong revenue growth and increased profitability despite the challenging macroeconomic environment. The enterprise technology provider’s first-quarter non-GAAP earnings jumped 6% year over year to 56 cents per share and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents. Revenues increased 1% year over year to $1.89 billion and beat the consensus mark of $1.84 billion. Let’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement. NCR Corporation Price and EPS Surprise NCR Corporation price-eps-surprise | NCR Corporation Quote Key Factors to Consider NCR’s second-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the strong demand for its software and service solutions across the banking, retail and hospitality industries. The rapid adoption of digital banking solutions is driving its Banking segment revenues. The company received positive feedback from customers on the new features and the functionality of its digital banking solutions. Our estimate for the Digital Banking division’s revenues is currently pegged at $134.6 million, suggesting year-over-year growth of 2.8%. In light of the pandemic and efforts to lower costs, hospitality-related businesses and food, restaurant, convenience, drug and fuel retail chain operators globally have been seeking technology to automate their processes. This has been driving the demand for NCR’s store and work operation automation-related software and service solutions. In the last reported quarter, revenues from the Retail segment grew 1.1% year over year, while the Hospitality division’s sales soared 5.7%. The trend is likely to have continued in the second quarter. However, a negative impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates is likely to have more than offset the benefits of the aforementioned factors for the Retail and Hospitality segments’ performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate for the Retail division’s revenues is currently pegged at $561.1 million, indicating a year-over-year decline of 0.2%. Our estimate for the Hospitality business unit suggests revenues to decline approximately 2.4% year over year and reach $232.4 million. NCR’s acquisition of Cardtronics last year is anticipated to have driven the acceleration of the NCR-as-a-service strategy. Cardtronics’ robust debit network expanded NCR’s payments platform and helped it connect with retail and bank customers, thereby facilitating customer acquisition. However, a strong U.S. dollar is likely to have more than offset the benefits. Our estimate for the Self-Service Banking segment is pegged at $649.6 million, indicating a year-over-year decline of 4.3%. Additionally, NCR’s overall second-quarter performance is likely to have been negatively impacted by softening IT spending as organizations are pushing back their investments in big and expensive technology products due to global economic slowdown concerns. Furthermore, the strong U.S. dollar, increased interest expenses and a higher tax rate are likely to have more than offset the benefits of last year’s pricing and cost actions. This is anticipated to have dragged the bottom line lower than the year-ago quarter. What Our Model Says Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for NCR this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here. Though NCR currently sports a Zacks Rank of #1, it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Stocks With the Favorable Combination Per our model, NVIDIA NVDA, Apple AAPL and Alibaba BABA have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases. NVIDIA is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Aug 23. The company sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an Earnings ESP of +5.56% at present. NVDA’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the trailing four quarters while missing the same on two occasions, the average surprise being 0.3%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.06 per share, suggesting a whopping increase of 303.9% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 51 cents. NVIDIA’s quarterly revenues are estimated to increase 64.4% year over year to $11.02 billion. Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.66%. The company is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Aug 3. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the preceding four quarters while missing the same on one occasion, with the average surprise being 2.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple’s third-quarter earnings stands at $1.19 per share, a penny lower than the year-ago quarter. It is estimated to report revenues of $81.26 billion, which suggests a decrease of approximately 2.1% from the year-ago quarter. Alibaba carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +6.19%. The company is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Aug 10. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 16.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BABA’s first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.90 per share, indicating a year-over-year increase of 8.6%. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $31.01 billion, suggesting a year-over-year rise of 1%. Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.

        "title": "Three Major Tech Firms Announcing Earnings This Week: What You Need To Know",
        "content": "<p>Three major U.S. firms will announce their quarterly earnings this week, making it a pivotal time for the U.S. economy. As a barometer of the health and performance of the U.S. economy, investors will scrutinize these results, hoping to make more informed decisions based on the findings, which will provide light on consumer spending, company investments, and market movements. The trajectory of the stock market and investor mood may hinge on the findings of these results. AMD Q2 Earnings On Tuesday, financial results will be released by Advance Micro Devices (AMD). Even though NVIDIA has been stealing the spotlight in the AI space, traders are betting that the industry as a whole is so vast that no one company can hope to corner the market. As a result, investors will probably mostly focus on AI-related remarks. Experts predict that sales will total $5.33 billion, down 18.8 percent from the prior-year period. The markets are betting that the weak demand for gaming and other gadgets will improve by the end of the year and into 2024. Perhaps more worrisome is the fact that sales of datacenter chips (used in data centers) are expected to fall by 5.8 percent this quarter. Adjusted earnings per share are predicted to fall for the fourth consecutive quarter, this time by 45 percent to $0.57. However, when additional data from the same time period is made public, rising earnings are expected to continue in the second half. Amazon&#039;s Q2 Earnings A company whose revenue is highly correlated with economic activity is Amazon (AMZN). A turnaround in consumer confidence has coincided with rising hopes that the U.S. economy might avert a recession. However, the company&#039;s quarterly profits are based on statistics from a time when economic mood was very low, so the present rise in sentiment is unlikely to have an effect on the results we&#039;ll get this week. Amazon&#039;s Web Services metrics are the most important to investors since they account for the vast majority of the company&#039;s income. It is anticipated that revenues will rise by 10% over the prior year, coming in at around $21.7 billion. It will be the sixth straight quarter of reduced growth, and again, this will be attributed to the fact that economic activity is slowing, if the actual result matches or even comes a little softer than this. Traders, however, are optimistic that Amazon&#039;s presence in the AI field will help it mitigate the effects of a slower growth rate on its stock price. Keep in mind that investors shouldn&#039;t count on much of an uptick, and look to Microsoft&#039;s profits for guidance; the company has deep ties to the AI industry thanks to its holdings in ChatGPT, but the stock hardly budged on the back of all the AI hoopla. The stock price dropped unjustly as a result of the hysteria around the company&#039;s association with the AI. The pressure on Amazon&#039;s margins from increasing inflation will be another area of attention among traders when it releases its results, and this is despite the fact that inflation-related difficulties have begun to lighten somewhat. The second quarter is forecast to see a 41.5% increase in operational profit, reaching $4.7 billion. The stock is selling at a significant discount to its all-time high from 2021, and there is a lot of possibility for growth given the company&#039;s participation in AI and the improvement in economic optimism. Q2 Results for Apple So far this year, Apple&#039;s (AAPL) profits have failed to excite Wall Street, but the stock price has generated significant interest from buyers. The new record high value brought the total assets of the corporation to $3 trillion. Overall, investors have low expectations for its quarterly results, and they anticipate a further slowdown in sales projection for the following quarter with relatively flat earnings. Revenues are expected to decrease by 1.8% from previous year, totaling $81.5 billion. Due to the economic recession, the decline in hardware demand is expected to be the most prominent story. The company&#039;s income is heavily dependent on iPhone sales, and analysts predict that those figures will continue to drop, potentially by 2.2%, to $38.8 billion. Consistent growth in Apple&#039;s service offerings like AppleCare, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and the App Store should contribute to a 5.8% increase in revenue, bringing total Apple revenue to $20.7 billion. The projected increase in adjusted earnings per share from the prior year to $1.20 would be the slowest of any of the major technology companies. Despite widespread pessimism, investors who wait until the price drops on the basis of bad earnings data may be rewarded if Apple announces a new iPhone in September. Apple also has a vested interest in maintaining its stock price; in the past, when earnings have been disappointing, the firm has responded by announcing share buybacks. Traders will pay great attention to the conference call and will search for the term \"AI\" throughout it. Apple hasn&#039;t used this word to increase profits yet, but there have been several rumors that the business will utilize its considerable influence to establish a presence in that industry. We&#039;ll look to see if we get any confirmation of that during their earnings report.

        "title": "Apple's iPhone Share in China Shows Positive Momentum, India Emerges as Rapidly Growing Market: Analyst Says Ahead Of Q3",
        "content": "<p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div><p>Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar maintained Apple Inc AAPL with an Overweight and raised the price target from $180 to $220.</p><p>Overall, Kumar feels Apple can execute its key segments and markets for the June quarter. More importantly, he estimates that Apple will deliver September assumptions that will match or slightly exceed street expectations primarily driven by strength in India for iPhone sales offset by general macro weakness in China. </p><p>For June, the analyst expects Apple to slightly miss street EPS expectations of $1.19 by between $0.02 to $0.04 and deliver revenue marginally lower than the street&#039;s $81.7 billion for the quarter. </p><p>Kumar expects dynamics around potential soft conditions in China to reflect in the September quarter guide. The Indian market, on the other hand, offers upside and potentially offsets any headwinds from China. </p><p>The analyst writes that Apple&#039;s iPhone sales in China will meet internal expectations. Still, he is concerned about other products from Apple, such as watches, AirPods, and Macs, about their sales within China, given the weak macroeconomic outlook for both June and September. </p><p>Over the last three quarters, he believes iPhone share within China has shown positive momentum. Just in 1Q23, for example, while the Chinese handset market declined by ~5%, Apple&#039;s share grew roughly 6%. In other words, the concerns about China&#039;s slow-down for iPhone might be relatively, if not wholly, overblown. </p><div>  </div><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div></div></div><p></p><p>Kumar estimates that Apple gets roughly 10% of its sales from phones in China. Assuming the Chinese market declines in the mid-single digits and Apple keeps up with that pace (worst case scenario), the impact will only amount to 0.5% of Apple&#039;s iPhone sales within the quarter. </p><p>By comparison, India is serving as a rapidly emerging market for Apple following the momentum from the first two brick-and-mortar stores recently opened in the country. Per counterpoint, India is likely to account for roughly 4% of iPhone sales for Apple within the upcoming June 2023 quarter, with reportedly a 50% Y/Y jump. </p><p>Apple will likely reach a goal of 5% share within India this year, up from roughly 2% last year, as the iPhone becomes the dominant handset in the high-end segment of the market. </p><div><div></div></div><p>Overall, Apple is holding up much better in the Chinese end market and might be able to offset meaningful declines, if any. While India is likely to contribute positively and more than offset any declines that Apple might see in the Chinese market. </p><p>The higher price target and multiple reflects his increased optimism for AAPL&#039;s execution in the back half of the year. </p><p>Price Action: AAPL shares traded higher by 0.22% at $196.23 on the last check Monday.</p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></p>"

        "content": "<p>Adds investment details in paragraphs 2 and 3 July 31 (Reuters) - Apple&#039;s AAPL.O main supplier, Foxconn Technology Group 2317.TW, is planning to invest close to $500 million to build two component factories in India, Bloomberg News reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter. These factories will be built in the southern state of Karnataka and at least one of them will produce Apple parts, including for iPhones, the report said. The exact locations of the new plants in the state are yet to be decided and a formal announcement is expected as early as this week. Foxconn and Apple did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. Karnataka has already approved investment to the tune of 80 billion rupees ($972.88 million) by a Foxconn unit in March, making it the third southern Indian state after Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu to allow Foxconn plants. As part of its investment drive in India in its bid to diversify beyond China, the Taiwanese company has also signed a deal with Tamil Nadu to invest 16 billion rupees in a new electronic components manufacturing facility that will create 6,000 jobs, the state government said on Monday. The Foxconn Industrial Internet 601138.SS facility will be built in the Kancheepuram district near the state capital of Chennai, a state government source said on condition of anonymity as details are not yet public.

Following the end of trading on Thursday (Aug 3), Apple (NASADQ:AAPL) will take its turn to announce its fiscal third quarter report.</p> <p>Going by recent Asia supply chain checks, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives expects Apple will post “at least in-line June quarter iPhone revenues with upside likely.”</p> <p>“We believe iPhone units based on a clear uptick in demand around the key China region this quarter could show some upside despite the choppy macro as higher ASPs and overall upgrade activity on iPhone Pro 14 carry the day for Cook &amp; Co,” the 5-star analyst expounded.</p> <p>What’s rather intriguing about the strong iPhone 14 demand, is that it is late in the iPhone cycle, given the iPhone 15 is expected to launch this fall.</p> <p>That is not the only piece of the Apple puzzle expected to put in a strong showing. Ives thinks Services revenue should “be on the upswing into FY24.” Combined, Apple should then deliver headline numbers that will “at least meet the Street’s expectations with the path higher for the stock with this new tech bull market now underway.”</p> <p>As for the September quarter, with the main event of the year being the anniversary iPhone 15 launch (slated for around mid-September), Ives is expecting a “relatively conservative” guide.</p> <p>With the handing over of the baton from one iPhone to another about to take place, Ives sees this handoff as being a “steadier transition than some other peak to valley iPhone cycles of the past.” Additionally, Ives is also encouraged by a “noteworthy trend” of rising ASPs (average selling prices) that are moving toward $900/$925 per iPhone.</p> <p>All told, looking forward to “another flex the muscles moment” from Apple, Ives maintains an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating on the shares, backed by a $220 price target. The implication for investors? Upside of 12% from current levels. (To watch Ives’ track record, click here)</p> <p>Most on the Street remain in Apple’s corner. The stock claims a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 24 Buys vs. 7 Holds. However, taking into account the big year-to-date gains (up by 57%), the $200.61 average target suggests the shares will remain rangebound for a while.

        "content": "<p><div> <div> <div></div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <p>A jubilant July typically heralds a sensational second half of the year. But history doesn’t always repeat itself.</p> <p>The S&amp;P 500 rose an impressive 3.1% last month. When the index has risen at least 2.5% in July, it averages a gain of 8.4% in the second half of the year, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p> <div> <div> <div> Newsletter Sign-up </div> <div>  </div> </div> <p>But, if 2023 is going to conform to that trend, investors may well be wondering where those gains are going to come from.</p> <p>Now that recession fears have subsided (part of the reason for last month’s gains), investors have shifted their focus when it comes to economic data. They can’t be too bad as to damage the economy and bring back recession concerns, but they can’t be too good as to push the Federal Reserve into more rate hikes. </p> <p>The sweet spot is likely to be data that are slightly below expectations. The Fed signaling an end to its hiking cycle is another potential catalyst.</p> <p>The history-matching gains are unlikely to come from this earnings season—despite being robust, companies have not been rewarded for beating expectations. </p> <p>S&amp;P 500 companies reporting positive surprises have actually suffered an average 0.2% share price decline in the period that runs from two days before earnings to two days after, according to FactSet data. That’s below the five-year average of a 1% jump.</p> <p>The magnitude of earnings surprises is also below historical averages, and expectations are low—which may explain the muted reaction. </p> <p>If any company can buck that trend, it’s likely to be Apple—which reports results Thursday. But the tech giant’s 51% gains so far in 2023 mean it needs to produce something special.</p> <p>The broader stock market also needs something out of the ordinary and a bit of luck, to keep the momentum going.</p> <div></div> <p>—Callum Keown</p> <p>*** Join Barron’s associate editor for technology Eric Savitz and Ben Reitzes, managing director and head of technology research of Melius Research, today at noon when they discuss the outlook for tech earnings, AI, and tech stocks.

This comes amid global oil prices rallying on optimism that recession fears have been overdone.</p> <ul> <li> BP’s underlying replacement cost profit—the company’s definition of net income—fell 69% to $2.6 billion, or 14.77 cents per share in the second quarter. Analysts were expecting net income of $3.4 billion, 19 cents per share. The British oil giant raised its dividend by 10% Tuesday and announced a new $1.5 billion share buyback program. </li> <li> The company’s earnings confirmed the industry trend of tumbling profits, compared with the same period last year when energy prices were soaring following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In recent earnings Exxon profit tumbled 55%, Shell dropped 56%, and Chevron declined 47%. </li> <li> “The BP share price, much like its peer Shell, has probably seen the highs of the year, given how far energy prices have fallen over the past 12 months,” CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson said early Tuesday. </li> </ul> <p>What’s Next: The strong run in global oil prices looks set to continue. The front-month nymex crude (WTI) is up 15.22% this month, according to Dow Jones market data. Statistically when oil rises at least 10% in the month of July there are average gains of 39.89% for oil over the second half of the year.</p> <p>—Callum Keown and </p> *** SoFi Technologies Gets a Jolt from Personal Loans, Deposits <p>  shares soared to a new 52-week high after beating second-quarter expectations, as a bump in home-loan and personal loan volumes helped overcome uncertainty about the future of federal student loan repayments. Shares jumped more than 20%.</p> <ul> <li> SoFi reported a narrower-than-expected loss, saying deposits rose 26% and personal-loan origination volume grew 51%, while student-loan volume fell 1%. CEO Anthony Noto told Barron’s in July the company expects “ample” demand from borrowers trying to refinance their loans. </li> <li> The fintech company now expects 2023 adjusted net revenue of $1.97 billion to $2.03 billion, higher than its previous guidance. Management continues to see student loan refinancings remaining around current levels until September and then rise. The company doesn’t expect a return to prepandemic levels this year. </li> <li> The Biden administration continues to pursue other ways to provide relief on federal student loans. Borrowers can start enrolling in a new income-driven repayment plan, which lowers the monthly amount they would pay from discretionary income to 5% from 10%. </li> <li> Borrowers can apply at the Education Department website. The administration is offering a 12-month “on ramp” to repayment, from Oct. 1, 2023 to Sept. 30, 2024, during which missed payments won’t be marked delinquent, hurt credit reports or trigger debt-collection agencies. </li> </ul> <p>What’s Next: Resuming federal student loan repayments in October will subtract about $9 billion a month from consumer spending, or $100 billion a year, said Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Sl k.</p> <p>—</p> ***   Travel Stocks Gain Attention as Americans Take Time Off <p>As Americans maintain their summer travel comeback after the Covid-19 pandemic, website traffic to major hotel websites ticked up more than 5% in May and early June, analytics firm SimilarWeb said. That’s a bullish sign for hotel stocks, according to Raymond James analyst William Crow.</p> <ul> <li> Crow’s favorite stocks include Hilton Worldwide Holdings, which has a pipeline of new growth, and Ryman Hospitality Properties, the locations of which in high-demand places such as Orlando and Denver are recording increased supply but few direct rivals in group travel. </li> <li> Crow warned that headwinds for hotels include higher operating and nonoperating costs (such as wages, property insurance, and property taxes), higher rates, slowing leisure demand, slow-to-recover business transient demand, and potential labor union issues. </li> <li> Oppenheimer analyst Jed Kelly raised his price targets on Expedia Group, and Booking Holdings, rating both travel booking stocks a buy-equivalent. He believes Expedia will benefit from “better hotel trends, operational improvements, and attractive valuation,” and Booking will “generate stable growth and margin expansion.” </li> <li> But he sidelined Airbnb stock for its higher valuation, and Tripadvisor because of increased competition for its Viator travel booking brand and the threat of artificial intelligence in trip planning. </li> </ul> <p>What’s Next: Unesco wants to add Venice to its list of World Heritage sites in danger from “irreversible” damage from climate change, mass tourism, and insufficient efforts by Italian officials to address ongoing issues. The recommendation could be adopted by UNESCO’s World Heritage Committee in Riyadh in September.</p> <p>—Teresa Rivas and Janet H. Cho</p> *** Arista Networks Beats Expectations and Signals Growth <p> Arista Networks shares traded sharply higher after the data-center-networking hardware provider posted second-quarter results that were better than analysts had feared. Shares rose 14% in late trading Monday.</p> <ul> <li> Arista shares fell last week on concerns about a potential slowdown in data center infrastructure demand, following disappointing results from rival Juniper Networks, and signs of moderating spending from Arista’s two biggest customers, Microsoft and Facebook’s Meta Platforms. </li> <li> For the June quarter, revenue rose 8% to $1.46 billion, ahead of Arista’s guidance, and Wall Street’s consensus estimate. Chief Financial Officer Ita Brennan said despite shorter lead times and reduced visibility, the company is executing well. It now sees revenue growth of more than 30% this year from last year. </li> <li> Database information provider ZoomInfo cut its September quarter guidance after second-quarter revenue rose 16% but came in slightly below expectations. It now sees September-quarter revenue of $309 million to $312 million, which is lower than Wall Street estimates. </li> </ul> <p>What’s Next: For the September quarter, Arista expects revenue of $1.45 billion to $1.5 billion, beating Wall Street expectations. Arista projects third-quarter adjusted gross margin of 62%, and adjusted operating margin of 41%.</p> <p>—Eric J. Savitz and Janet H. Cho</p> *** There’s Another $1 Billion Lottery Jackpot Up for Grabs <p>There’s yet another $1 billion multistate lottery jackpot up for grabs. The Mega Millions grand prize—actually estimated around $1.05 billion—is the fourth-largest in that lottery’s history. The drawing is at 11 p.m. Eastern time tonight.</p> <ul> <li> Lotteries have been getting bigger since 2016, when multistate lottery operators made shifts that lowered the odds and encouraged big jackpots. There have been seven claimed winning tickets of $1 billion or more since then. </li> <li> The person or group who won the $1.08 billion jackpot in a July Powerball lottery hasn’t come forward, perhaps because California, the place where the sole ticket with all the winning numbers hit, requires winners to identify themselves by their full names. New York has the same rule, but state lawmakers want a law to allow winners to remain anonymous. </li> <li> At least eight states already allow anonymity, including Delaware, Kansas, Maryland, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Wyoming. Eric Jaffe, a lawyer who has arranged LLCs for New York winners to shield their identities, said safety is an issue. “The risk is just too great.” </li> <li> It’s the second time this year that Mega Millions has grown to more than $1 billion. Powerball, also sold in 45 states and Washington, D.C., grew to more than $2 billion before a winning ticket was drawn last November. </li> </ul> <p>What’s Next: If a winning ticket is drawn tonight, there’s an option to take the 30-year annuity payout with an initial payment of roughly $15 million, or a lump sum, estimated at around $528 million.</p> <p>—Liz Moyer</p> ***   <div>  <div> <p id=\"p_0f86401bd20aa14242db5caaa9516a2c\" class=\"img_p\" ><img src=\"https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/ON-GK726_DailyT_OR_20230626115644.png?width=700&height=172\" id=\"0f86401bd20aa14242db5caaa9516a2c\" onerror=\"javascript: this.parentNode.style.display='none'; \" /></p><p></p> </div>   Uncredited    </div> <p>Be sure to join this month’s Barron’s Daily virtual stock exchange challenge and .</p> <p>Each month, we’ll start a new challenge and invite newsletter readers—you!—to build a portfolio using virtual money and compete against the Barron’s and MarketWatch community.</p> <p>Everyone will start with the same amount and can trade as often or as little as they choose.

        "title": "Gen Digital (GEN) to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in Store?",
        "content": "<p>Gen Digital GEN is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Aug 3. Gen Digital was formerly known as NortonLifeLock Inc. and was trading under the NLOK ticker symbol. NortonLifeLock changed its name and ticker symbol, effective from Nov 8, 2022, following the completed merger of NortonLifeLock and Avast Plc. The newly named company unites trusted consumer safety brands, including Norton, Avast, LifeLock, AVG, Avira, CCleaner and ReputationDefender. The company projects quarterly revenues between $940 million and $950 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $947.2 million, indicating a 33.8% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $708 million. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Gen Digital expects non-GAAP earnings in the range of 45 cents-47 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 46 cents per share, a penny higher than the year-ago reported figure of 45 cents. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters while matching the same on one occasion, the average surprise being 5.3%. Let’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement. Gen Digital Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Gen Digital Inc. price-eps-surprise | Gen Digital Inc. Quote Factors to Note Gen Digital’s first-quarter top line is likely to have been primarily driven by the inclusion of the Avast business, which has significantly increased the combined company’s Average Direct Customer count. Our first-quarter estimate for this key metric is pegged at 37.8 million, which is close to 38.2 million at the end of the last reported quarter. Moreover, the expansion of product offerings following the merger of NortonLifeLock and Avast is likely to have facilitated the newly formed company to cross-sell products to each other’s customers, thereby aiding Average Revenue Per User (“ARPU”) growth. Gen Digital’s ARPU increases 15 cents sequentially to $7.24 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. We anticipate the trend is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. Our first-quarter fiscal 2024 estimate for ARPU is pegged at $7.31, which is 7 cents higher than the fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 level. GEN’s first-quarter performance is also likely to have benefited from the increased demand for cybersecurity and ID analytics solutions amid the hybrid work environment. Over the past couple of years, as more people are shifting online, the need for online privacy has been rising. Global workforces working remotely are logging into employers&#039; networks, escalating the need for digital security. This trend is likely to have spurred the demand for Gen Digital’s security products in the fiscal first quarter. Our first-quarter estimate for Gen Digital’s Consumer Security segment’s revenues is pegged at $572.7 million, indicating a year-over-year increase of 42.5%. Our estimate of $357.1 million for the Identity and Information Protection division implies growth of 21.5% from the year-ago quarter. An expansion in the EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin American regions is also likely to have been an upside for GEN this season. Further, the growing number of client bookings, supported by their retention and renewal rates, is anticipated to have contributed to the company’s fiscal first-quarter top line. At the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, Gen Digital’s client retention rate was 76%, while bookings grew 29% on a year-over-year basis. The Norton and Avast antivirus maker’s sustained focus on growing partner channels and employee benefit programs is likely to have driven its performance in the quarter to be reported. Our estimate for the company’s Partner revenues is pegged at $96.8 million, which calls for a 34.4% increase from the year-ago quarter. Additionally, Direct Customer revenues are expected to increase 33.5% year over year to $833 million, per our estimate. However, GEN’s overall first-quarter performance is likely to have been negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rates. In the last reported financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, foreign currency headwinds lowered revenues by $21 million. Additionally, increased interest expenses due to enhanced debt related to Avast acquisition financing are likely to have weighed on the bottom line. Moreover, the company’s earnings per share are expected to have been negatively impacted by the equity dilution impact of the Avast acquisition. To finance the acquisition of Avast, Gen Digital issued 94 million new shares. What Our Model Says Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Gen Digital this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here. Though GEN currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3, it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Stocks With the Favorable Combination Per our model, NVIDIA NVDA, Apple AAPL and Alibaba BABA have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases. NVIDIA is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Aug 23. The company sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an Earnings ESP of +5.56% at present. NVDA’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the trailing four quarters while missing the same on two occasions, the average surprise being 0.3%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.06 per share, suggesting a whopping increase of 303.9% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 51 cents. NVIDIA’s quarterly revenues are estimated to increase 64.4% year over year to $11.02 billion. Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.66%. The company is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Aug 3. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the preceding four quarters while missing the same on one occasion, with the average surprise being 2.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple’s third-quarter earnings stands at $1.19 per share, a penny lower than the year-ago quarter. It is estimated to report revenues of $81.26 billion, which suggests a decrease of approximately 2.1% from the year-ago quarter. Alibaba carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +6.19%. The company is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Aug 10. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 16.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BABA’s first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.90 per share, indicating a year-over-year increase of 8.6%. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $31.01 billion, suggesting a year-over-year rise of 1%. Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.

        "title": "Atlassian (TEAM) to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in the Offing?",
        "content": "<p>Atlassian TEAM is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Aug 3. Atlassian projects fiscal fourth-quarter revenues between $900 million and $920 million ($910 million at the midpoint). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $911.2 million, suggesting growth of 19.9% from the year-ago reported figure. For fourth-quarter earnings, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 43 cents per share, implying a 59.3% increase from 27 cents reported in the year-ago period. Atlassian surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters while missing the same on one occasion, the average surprise being 26.9%. Let’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement. Atlassian Corporation PLC Price and EPS Surprise Atlassian Corporation PLC price-eps-surprise | Atlassian Corporation PLC Quote Key Factors to Note The rising adoption of TEAM’s cloud-based solutions and the massive digitalization trend in organizations, along with the growing hybrid working trend, are likely to have favored the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter performance. The growing demand for Atlassian’s cloud products from new and existing clients using on-premises products might have acted as a tailwind. Our estimate for revenues from Cloud deployment is pegged at $554.3 million, indicating a 27.7% increase from the year-ago quarter. Revenues from Data Center deployment are anticipated to grow 38.1% year over year to $219.5 million. The increasing traction for core products like Jira Software and Confluence Cloud and the rising adoption of new products like Jira Service Management may have acted as key catalysts. An improvement in product quality and performance, multiple product launches and increased pricing are also likely to have boosted the firm’s performance. Atlassian’s latest focus on adding AI features to some of its collaboration software is likely to have driven the fourth-quarter top line. In April 2023, the company collaborated with OpenAI to enhance the capabilities of its Confluence, Jira Service Management and other programs with generative AI features. Robust growth in subscription revenues, aided by the solid uptake of the company’s subscription-based offerings, is likely to be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter’s results. Our estimate of $764.5 million for the Subscription segment’s revenues indicates massive 28% year-over-year growth. A large number of customers are opting for cloud offerings amid the ongoing cloud migration. Such new additions and increased pricing on certain products contributed to the company’s quarterly revenues. Our estimate suggests that TEAM is likely to have ended the fourth quarter with 266,330 customers, which will be a significant improvement of 9.8% year over year and 2.5% sequentially. Additionally, Atlassian’s sustained focus on cost savings is likely to have boosted the fourth-quarter bottom line. The company expects that its March 2023 announced restructuring actions, which include a reduction of lease-related expenses and total workforce by 5% or 500 employees, will benefit the fourth-quarter operating income by $20 million. What Our Model Says Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Atlassian this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.

        "title": "India's Redington's quarterly profit falls as expenses mount",
        "content": "<p>CHENNAI, Aug 1 (Reuters) - India&#039;s Redington REDI.NS reported a 21% fall in quarterly profit on Tuesday, as the technology devices distributor wrestled with higher expenses at a time when demand for work-from-home equipment also slowed. The Chennai-based company, which distributes IT products of global giants like Apple AAPL.O and Dell Technologies DELL.N, said net profit dropped to 2.49 billion rupees ($30.3 million) for the quarter ended June 30, compared with 3.16 billion rupees a year earlier. Corporations globally are reeling from the impact of higher expenses, partly due to higher interest rates, while several firms including Redington are also investing heavily to digitize their businesses more. The company reported expenses climbing 27%, which ate into its bottomline. A pandemic-led demand for consumer electronics, including smartphones and personal computers, is fading as people are spending more time in physical schools and offices, denting demand for work- and learn-from-home equipment. Revenue from operations rose 26% to 211.87 billion rupees but dropped 3% sequentially. Revenue from its rest of the world unit, which makes up more than half of its topline and includes the Middle East, Turkey and Africa, dropped around 5% from the previous quarter even as it jumped 29% from a year earlier. Shares of Redington closed 1.6% higher ahead of its results, with the stock up just over 1% this year.

        "title": "New Leaders Emerge: S&P 500 Shows Shift in Top Performers",
        "content": "<p>It wasn’t that long ago that the “Magnificent 7” stocks, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA), Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META) were pretty much the only game in town. Since late May, other stocks have been rotating into leadership. As of July 31, the top S&amp;P 500 performers and their year-to-date returns were: Nvidia: 219.90% Meta Platforms: 170.47% Carnival Corp. (NYSE: CCL): 129.40% Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE: RCL): 119.64% Tesla: 116.30% PulteGroup Inc. (NYSE: PHM): 86.29% Align Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: ALGN): 81.08% Palo Alto Networks Inc. (NASDAQ: PANW): 78.04% Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NYSE: NCLH): 75.98% General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE): 74.95% That’s quite a different list from the one you would have seen a couple of months ago. In particular, as cruise lines sail to higher prices, the makeup of S&amp;P top performers is changing. Equal-Weighted S&amp;P As Gauge Of Breadth One informative way to slice and dice the performance of S&amp;P internals is by comparing the performance of the equal-weighted index with the traditional market-cap weighted. As its name implies, the S&amp;P 500 equal-weighted index assigns an equal weighting to each constituent, providing a balanced representation of all included stocks. That means no component, regardless of its market capitalization, has outsized influence over index performance. This approach tends to tilt the index toward the smaller holdings, which are frequently more volatile than the mega-caps that dominate the market-cap-weighted index. That volatility isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as it can, at times, lead to outperformance. You can track the S&amp;P equal-weighted index with the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight ETF (NYSEARCA: RSP). While the equal-weighted index can provide a more diversified representation of components, giving smaller companies an equal sway as larger ones and potentially reducing concentration risk, the traditional market-cap weighted index is still outperforming by a wide margin. Not Unusual To See Performance Divergence So far this year, the market-cap-weighted S&amp;P 500 is outpacing the equal-weighted index by 97%. It’s not necessarily unusual to see that disparity at this juncture; there’s generally a cyclical nature to the indexes’ returns, as the market-cap weighted tends to outperform as the market is rebounding, as is happening this year. Still, the performance of the equal-weight index offers one more data point to support the case that breadth is returning to markets. A look at the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight ETF’s chart shows the fund is within a whisker of clearing a base that began in early February. So what does the performance of equal-weighted S&amp;P leaders mean for market breadth? How Smaller Companies Contribute To Index Return The equal-weighted index shows how smaller companies are contributing to the overall market; as their performance improves, as we’re clearly seeing with the cruise lines, they frequently bring other industry peers along with them. To use a cliche that’s appropriate in this case: A rising tide can lift all - or at least other - boats. Stock market breadth is considered bullish when many stocks across various sectors and market capitalizations participate in an uptrend. A broad-based rally indicates a healthy market as more companies see positive price movements, reflecting overall investor optimism. Greater Breadth Suggests Greater Confidence A high degree of market breadth suggests broad confidence and positive sentiment, often indicating a robust and more sustainable rally. It also signifies that multiple industries and companies are contributing to the market&#039;s strength, making it less reliant on the performance of a few heavily-weighted stocks or sectors. It’s that latter point that has made investors nervous all year, even as AI, cloud computing and electric vehicles sent some stocks on rocket rides. While it’s certainly possible the market will see a pullback before year’s end, it’s statistically unlikely that 2023 will be a down year in the market. Historically, down years are most often followed by a year with S&amp;P 500 price gains. Increased breadth only makes that likelihood stronger, as it’s not up to just big techs to carry the entire market on their backs.

Okay, more like a little nonplussed. Apple’s latest moves very slightly unnerved investors, who pulled out in small numbers, leaving Apple down fractionally in Tuesday afternoon’s trading.</p> <p>First, Apple took a proactive stance and pulled several apps from the Chinese App Store variant ahead of China’s upcoming crackdown on generative AI systems. That means apps like ChatGPT—as well as ChatGPT itself—were pulled from the store in advance. The potential bans won’t kick in until August 15, but Apple clearly got out in front of it. The action the Chinese government looks to take isn’t even really a ban, but requires so many caveats—AI apps must not seek to overthrow the government, and must “respect social morality and ethics”, as well as promote “core values of socialism”, among other things—that it’s likely not worth trying to jump through all those hoops for the sake of a handful of apps.</p> <p>This news comes on the heels of much more pleasant news, as Apple also recently showed off its iPhone 15. Several “major changes” are in the offing this time around, as Apple shows off titanium edges—which might be useful in the face of, say, a dropped phone—as well as a whole new charging port. Thanks to EU regulations, the iPhone 15 and the iPhone 15 Plus will work with USB-C chargers.</p>  <p id=\"p_d68e29ef0598ff32dd78cd69976fcc26\" class=\"img_p\" ><img src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-01-at-12-51-02-Apple-AAPL-Stock-Forecast-Price-Targets-and-Analysts-Predictions-TipRanks.com_-1024x448.png\" id=\"d68e29ef0598ff32dd78cd69976fcc26\" onerror=\"javascript: this.parentNode.style.display='none'; \" /></p><p></p>  <p>Analysts, meanwhile, are largely undeterred. Apple stock currently merits a Strong Buy rating, supported by 24 Buy ratings and seven Hold. Meanwhile, Apple stock also offers an upside potential of 3.34% thanks to its average price target of $202.19.</p>  Continue Reading </div> </div> </div></p>"

        "title": "What to Watch When Amazon Reports Q2 Earnings This Week",
        "content": "<p>This week, both Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) are scheduled to release their quarterly earnings and wrap up the reporting season for FAANG stocks. With a year-to-date gain of 57%, Amazon is outperforming the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ($NASX) in 2023, and is the second-best performing FAANG stock of the year – trailing only Meta Platforms (META) which has soared a whopping 167% this year amid its focus on “efficiency.”www.barchart.com While Amazon stock is outperforming this year, it shed almost half of its value in 2022. The stock underperformed its tech peers in 2021, as well, and barely finished that year in the green - lagging the broader market by a wide margin. Amazon to Report Q2 Earnings on Thursday Amazon is scheduled to report its Q2 earnings after the close this Thursday, Aug. 3. Analysts expect the Seattle-based company to post revenues of $131.4 billion for the period, up 8.3% year-over-year and within the $127 billion-$133 billion guidance range provided with Amazon&#039;s Q1 earnings release. Ahead of the report, analysts expect Amazon’s earnings per share (EPS) to rise 240% to $0.34 in the quarter. The company does not provide EPS guidance - but during the Q1earnings call Amazon forecast Q2 operating income between $2 billion and $5.5 billion, compared to $3.3 billion in the second quarter of 2022. www.barchart.com Beyond these headline numbers, investors should watch for several other key metrics in Amazon’s upcoming earnings release. AWS, Ad Results in Focus Investors should watch the revenue growth and margins of Amazon&#039;s North America segment for signs of continued improvement. In Q1 2023, the segment’s revenues rose 11% while operating income came in at $0.9 billion, compared to an operating loss of $1.6 billion in the first quarter of 2022. The enterprise-focused Amazon Web Services (AWS) business in particular is one to watch, as revenue growth for the segment fell to an all-time low of 16% in the first quarter. The cloud segment was previously a key driver of Amazon’s profitability and cash flows; last year, only AWS posted an operating profit, while both the North America and International segments posted an operating loss. In fact, Amazon stock fell after its Q1 2023 earnings release, as management&#039;s commentary on the lucrative AWS cloud business overshadowed the company&#039;s earnings beat. As a point of comparison, competitor Alphabet (GOOG) reported a 28% rise in its cloud revenues for the second quarter, while Microsoft (MSFT) said that Azure cloud revenues rose 26% YoY over the period. Elsewhere, Amazon said its 2023 Prime Day, held earlier in July, was its biggest ever. During theearnings call the online retailer might comment on whether it is looking to host a second Prime Day in 2023 to bolster results, as in 2022. Investors should also watch the performance of Amazon&#039;s advertising business, which generated revenues of $9.5 billion in Q1 2023 – 21% higher than the corresponding period last year. The segment has performed well, despite the overall slowdown in the digital ad market. What to Watch on the Conference Call Investors should also tune in for updates to Amazon’s guidance, especially on that crucial AWS segment. During the Q1 2023earnings call Amazon’s CFO Brian Olsavsky said, “customers continue to evaluate ways to optimize their cloud spending in response to these tough economic conditions in the first quarter.” When the company reports Q2 results later this week, investors should look for any change in tone or additional insights into how AWS customers are budgeting for the cloud amid a challenging environment for corporate spending. During theearnings call AMZN might also talk about its artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives. The company is looking to increase delivery speeds and cut logistics costs by implementing AI, and is reportedly looking to add generative AI features to the shopping platform. Plus, a leaked email suggests Amazon has also formed a new internal team focused on AI, reporting directly to CEO Andy Jassy. Finally, in response to slower revenue growth, many large-cap U.S. tech companies have resorted to aggressive cost cuts to boost their earnings, and Amazon is no exception. The company has already taken several steps to lower expenses - like pausing the construction of its HQ2 in Virginia, and cutting 27,000 corporate jobs. If Amazon provides more insights into its cost-cutting efforts on theearnings call it could be a positive catalyst. Wall Street Analysts are Bullish on Amazon Ahead of its quarterly results, Wall Street analysts are bullish on Amazon stock, and most rate it a Strong Buy. www.barchart.com Of the 36 analysts that cover AMZN, 31 rate it a Strong Buy, 4 a Moderate Buy, and 1 a Hold. None of the analysts has a Sell rating on Amazon, and its mean target price of $147.14 is 10% above current stock prices. Ahead of this week&#039;s earnings release, Evercore ISI maintained its overweight rating on the stock, and referred to AWS revenue growth as the “A-word” that could unleash value in AMZN. The brokerage has listed AMZN as one of its top Large Cap picks. Bank of America (BAC) is also bullish on AMZN heading into earnings, and believes that improvement in retail margins and AWS growth would support an expansion of the stock’s multiples. The ball is in Amazon&#039;s court as it prepares to release Q2 earnings later this week and wrap up what has been a mixed earnings season for FAANG shares so far. After a tough first quarter for the segment, don&#039;t be surprised if it&#039;s those AWS results, specifically, that drive the stock&#039;s direction immediately after earnings.

In the second quarter, the fund returned +8.0% on a net basis which brought the year-to-date net performance to +9.0%. This compares to Russell 2000’s +5.2% gain for Q2 and +8.1% year-to-date. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2023.</p> <p>Choice Equities Capital Management highlighted stocks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the second quarter 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in Cupertino, California, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a multinational technology company that designs and manufactures smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables, and accessories. On August 1, 2023, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock closed at $195.60 per share. One-month return of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was 2.23%, and its shares gained 17.74% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Apple Inc.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:</p> <div>  <p>\"Dramatic valuation differences across market cap sizes continue. This has been the case for some time now. Perhaps I have spent too much time discussing these dichotomies, as generally, I feel like if we pick the right stocks and manage market exposures thoughtfully, our equities- oriented portfolio will prosper across various market cycles. However, when markets become as lopsided as they have lately, I feel additional discussion on the market environment is worthwhile, if only to help highlight the opportunities that are available and the likely path forward. I expect future discussions to soon be focused again on our moderately concentrated portfolio. But for now, let’s take one last in-depth look at how far reaching these valuation dichotomies have again become.(Please note: charts that accompany the following can be found in the Appendix.)</p> <p>Take Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for example. It is the largest stock by market cap, and fairly considered one of the best companies in the world. The company has been extraordinarily successful and improved standards of living everywhere in the process with their ubiquitous products. Along the way, shareholders have been richly rewarded, with shares increasing nearly fourteen-fold over the last ten years while generating an annualized total shareholder return of 31%, including dividends.</p> <p>On the back of another big quarter for large cap tech, it is now the first stock to surpass the $3T market cap threshold. This makes its weighting in the ~$37T market cap of the S&amp;P 500, ~8%. It also means this one stock’s market cap is larger than that of the entire ~$2.98T market cap of the Russell 2000 index, the first time in history a single stock has outweighed the Russell 2000 – aside from two brief days in September 2020 when Apple’s market cap then accomplished the same...\" (Click here to read the full text)</p>  </div> <div> Story continues </div>  <div> <div> <div> <p id=\"p_7184477a6620b928ccc8f67cd49cf5d9\" class=\"img_p\" ><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/JNgbSruc180tY7GJkHyajA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/insidermonkey.com/c5f4022a295b1bd69ec2f372544408d1\" id=\"7184477a6620b928ccc8f67cd49cf5d9\" onerror=\"javascript: this.parentNode.style.display='none'; \" /></p><p></p>  <p id=\"p_7184477a6620b928ccc8f67cd49cf5d9\" class=\"img_p\" ><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/JNgbSruc180tY7GJkHyajA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/insidermonkey.com/c5f4022a295b1bd69ec2f372544408d1\" id=\"7184477a6620b928ccc8f67cd49cf5d9\" onerror=\"javascript: this.parentNode.style.display='none'; \" /></p><p></p>  </div> </div> </div>  <p>Apple Inc.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is having one of those days today, as it was the beneficiary of major new developments, yet none of those were enough to compel investor interest. Apple slipped somewhat in Wednesday afternoon’s trading despite new product announcements and welcome updates from analysts. One of the major developments to hit Apple today was a report from JPMorgan, who—via analyst Samik Chatterjee—hiked the price target on Apple from $190 to $235 per share. </p> <p>Chatterjee noted that Apple is in a great position to keep investors confident in its path forward, a point reflected in the price target set, which is now a new high. Further, Chatterjee pointed out that Apple’s success in replacement cycles in hardware, as well as its ongoing potential for growth in its services sector, should work well together to produce cash flow at any time.</p> <p>It also helps that Apple is moving to keep its hardware lines up to date. Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst with TF International Securities, recently noted that the second-generation Apple AirTag was likely to go into wide production next year, most likely in the fourth quarter. Though it’s changed substantially over the last few years, that’s right around prime time for the holiday shopping season, especially if Apple can angle it toward the front of the fourth quarter rather than the back. Also coming in late 2024 is the Vision Pro headset, which will also set up a whole new line of business for Apple.</p>  <p id=\"p_46f7e4f7d414326c9d1d4fcefce7654a\" class=\"img_p\" ><img src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-02-at-13-52-51-Apple-AAPL-Stock-Forecast-Price-Targets-and-Analysts-Predictions-TipRanks.com_-1024x422.png\" id=\"46f7e4f7d414326c9d1d4fcefce7654a\" onerror=\"javascript: this.parentNode.style.display='none'; \" /></p><p></p>  <p>Analysts, meanwhile, don’t have much trouble supporting Apple.

        "content": "<p><p>We’ve heard from the Fed, the Commerce Department, and an army of economists. Now it&#039;s time to hear from two of the other key pillars of the U.S. economy: Apple and Amazon.</p> <p>The twin tech giants, which collectively account for more than $4 trillion of market cap as well as billions of dollars of consumer and business spending, are due to report quarterly earnings after Thursday&#039;s market close.</p> <p>The companies&#039; results—and just as importantly, their forecasts for the coming months—will add vital data that could confirm recent hopes that a , or  about the business landscape.</p> <p>“When Cook talks everyone else listens given Apple&#039;s unique perch and perspective around consumer demand globally and what this means for the path looking forward,” Wedbush’s Dan Ives wrote in a recent note to investors.</p> <p>From the sales of iPhones and Macs, to the volume of online shopping and the spending by companies on cloud computing services, Apple and Amazon together provide one of the most well-rounded snapshots of market conditions.</p> <p>Amazon, which employs more than 1.5 million workers, is the world’s second largest online retailer (in addition to owning the Whole Foods supermarket chain, which Bloomberg recently reported is being overhauled in a bid by Amazon to go after Walmart’s brick-and-mortar empire).</p> <p>In July, Amazon announced that it had experienced the largest Prime Day sales ever. Prime members purchased over 375 million items and saved more than $2.5 billion in total (Amazon did not say how much money shoppers actually spent), compared to 300 million items and $1.7 billion last year. This revenue won’t show up in the second quarter results, but it’s a positive sign for consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of U.S. GDP.</p> Taylor Swift vs the iPhone <p>D. A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote in a recent report that the Prime Day numbers could raise hopes of a spending pickup in the home and consumer electronics categories, following a phase in which post-COVID “revenge travel” and in-person, live events have captured a lot of consumers’ discretionary income.</p> <div> Story continues </div> <p>or , Apple may have a hard time competing right now—especially given that the iPhone is awaiting its Fall upgrade to a new model. Analysts expect Apple to post its third consecutive year-over-year revenue decline during the recently ended quarter, and many investors will be more interested in the company’s outlook for the remainder of the year.</p> <p>D. A. Davidson’s Forte told Fortune the iPhone is more like a consumer staple than a discretionary item — it’s a necessity, not a rewarding purchase. That’s not a bad thing in a challenging macro-economic environment — iPhones keep selling while consumers do without other products. And indeed, Apple&#039;s stock is up nearly 60% this year, as investors find comfort in its stable business.</p> <div> <div></div> </div> <p>But while expectations for iPhone sales are modest, Forte says a key question is what it would mean if iPhone sales do worse than expected?</p> <p>“If Apple reports weaker than expected iPhone sales...then it would suggest that the macroeconomic pressure may be negatively affecting products that we perceive to be a consumer staple, not a discretionary item,” Forte said.</p> <p>Many investors will also be looking to overseas markets like China and India for signs of strength in Apple’s business and in the global economy.</p> Amazon&#039;s cloud barometer <p>If consumer spending disappoints in Apple’s or Amazon’s reports, the performance of Amazon’s cloud business could become particularly important to the broader economic picture. When the Commerce Department reported that U.S. GDP increased 2.4% in Q2, it noted that business spending surged by 7.7%. That&#039;s an encouraging sign for cloud computing services that cater to corporate customers.</p> <p>Amazon’s cloud rivals delivered mixed results in the second quarter, with Microsoft reporting weaker-than-expected cloud revenue growth, while Google’s cloud business posted its first ever profit. Analysts expect Amazon’s AWS cloud business revenue to increase by 9% year-over-year in Q2, according to CRN.</p> <p>While Amazon AWS is in a fierce battle for market share against Microsoft and Google, its position as the dominant cloud provider makes it an important gauge of broader corporate cloud spending.</p> <p>For Amazon investors as well as for those reading economic tea leaves, the AWS outlook will provide plenty of fuel for thought.</p> <p>This story was originally featured on Fortune.com</p> <p>More from Fortune: </p><p></p><p></p></p>"

        "content": "<p>Recasts with flood management details BEIJING, Aug 3 (Reuters) - China&#039;s disaster-response systems are being put to the test as floodwaters from record rainfall could take weeks to recede with thousands of people still unable to return to their homes, state media reported on Thursday. Authorities in northern Hebei province raised the natural disaster emergency response level to II from III, while Beijing kept a warning in place for landslides on its outskirts, the state broadcaster and city government said. The Hai river basin, where five rivers converge in northern China, is going through a \"flood evolution process\" and flood-control engineering systems are experiencing the \"most severe test\" since inundations in 1996, state media reported. Floodwaters could take up to a month to recede in Hebei province, where Zhuozhou is the hardest hit city, a water resources department official told state media. About 100,000 people in the city southwest of Beijing were forced to leave their homes by the rising waters. The floods have spread since Typhoon Doksuri swept into southern China on Friday. The remnants of the typhoon have started drifting into northeast China after breaking a 140-year rainfall record in Beijing and dumping more than a year&#039;s rain in Hebei province earlier this week. While the rain has eased, scores of reservoirs have been enabled to divert and trap floodwater as it flows downstream, state broadcaster CCTV reported. China is facing more stormy weather with Typhoon Khanun currently swirling over the East China Sea towards Japan, and forecast to approach China&#039;s Zhejiang and Fujian provinces by Friday. American phonemaker Apple Inc AAPL.O Chief Executive Tim Cook said in a post on popular microblog Weibo that the company will donate to the flood-relief efforts in Beijing and Hebei.

TASS said it was the first time Apple had been fined for that offence. Apple did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. The company paused all product sales in Russia shortly after Moscow sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022, and limited its Apple Pay service in Russia. Moscow has clashed with Big Tech for years over content, censorship, data and local representation in disputes that escalated after Russia sent its armed forces into Ukraine. Apple paid a 906-million-rouble fine in a Russian antitrust case alleging abuse of its dominance in the mobile apps market, Russia&#039;s Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) said in February. Apple, which did not comment then, had previously appealed and \"respectfully disagreed\" with a FAS ruling that Apple&#039;s distribution of apps through its iOS operating system gave its own products a competitive advantage.

Fitch&#039;s action hit the appetite for risky assets on Wednesday, dragging Wall Street sharply lower as investors took the opportunity to book profits on five months of gains. Megacap growth and technology stocks including Apple AAPL.O, Alphabet GOOGL.Oand Microsoft MSFT.O slipped between 0.2% and 0.4% in premarket trading, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note US10YT=RRhovering around its highest since November. \"US equities, especially cyclicals, look vulnerable to further downside after a strong run - either on disappointment in the data relative to lofty expectations or on renewed hawkishness from the Fed,\" Karen Reichgott Fishman, senior strategist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note. Traders will closely monitor initial jobless claims for the week ended July 29 to assess the labor market&#039;s strength after a private payrolls report on Wednesday showed continued resilience. The report is due at 8:30 a.m. ET. U.S. non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers&#039; Index (PMI), June factory orders and comments from Richmond Federal Reserve President Thomas Barkin are also on the radar. At 07:00 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were down 54 points, or 0.15%, S&amp;P 500 e-minis EScv1 were down 10 points, or 0.22%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were down 52.25 points, or 0.34%. Earnings are also in focus as Apple and Amazon.com AMZN.O are due to report quarterly results after market close. Of the two-thirds of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported so far, 79.9% have topped earnings estimates, according to Refinitiv data on Wednesday. QualcommQCOM.O tumbled 8.4% in trading before the bell as the San Diego, California-based company&#039;s fourth-quarter sales forecast fell below market expectations. The company said it would likely cut jobs as consumer spending on gadgets such as smartphones remained stubbornly weak amid slowing global economic growth. Peers Nvidia NVDA.O and Intel INTC.O eased 0.5% each.

        "title": "Apple (AAPL) Q3 2023 Earnings: What to Expect",
        "content": "<p>Apple (AAPL) stock has gone on an impressive run, rising some 50% year to date, almost three times the 18% gain in the S&amp;P 500 index. Its shares have returned more than 30% just in the past six months, pushing the tech giant past a $3 trillion valuation. The market is clearly bullish on the company’s growth potential. Investors want to know whether it is time to take profits or if the momentum can continue. Investors are also excited about prospects for the new iPhone 15 which is scheduled to launch in September. How many new phones will Apple sell and how will it guide for the holiday quarter? These answers will be more clear when the tech giant reports third quarter fiscal 2023 earnings results after the closing bell Thursday. However, for this quarter, it’s not going to be just about the iPhone. Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng expects Apple to surpass earnings estimates, led by strength in its Mac and Services segments. Ng is expecting Services revenue of $21.8 billion to rise 11% year over year, clearing Wall Street forecasts of $20.7 billion. “Upside to our Services forecast reflects the inflection in App Store spending, per Sensor Tower, strong growth in advertising, continued content investments in AppleTV, and a more benign forex headwind relative to company guidance of -400 bps,\" Ng wrote in an investor note. The market will also look for additional details about the its long-awaited mixed reality headset, dubbed Vision Pro, which was unveiled at the company&#039;s Worldwide Developers Conference. Wall Street analysts were impressed, including Credit Suisse analyst Shannon Cross who said the device \"solves many of the technical limitations.” At a hefty price tag of $3,499, the questions becomes how much revenue and profits can Apple expect upon launch. This and other topics will be front and center on the conference call with analysts on Thursday. In the three months that ended June, Wall Street expect the Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant to earn $1.19 per share on revenue of $81.63 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to $1.20 per share on revenue of $82.96 billion. For the full year, ending in October, earnings are expected to decline 2.2% year over year to $5.98 per share, while full-year revenue of $384.99 billion will decline 2.4% year over year. The tech giant has benefited from, among other things, the re-opening of China, its second-largest market. Despite the overall smartphone market shrinking amid an economic slowdown, recent reports suggests Apple is still gaining share in the Chinese smartphone market during the second-quarter, with iPhone sales rising 6.1%. Apple’s overall Chinese smartphone market shares stands at 15.3%, according to research firm IDC, which noted a 2.1% decline in Q2 smartphone shipments in China. It’s notable that Apple still experienced growth. Could that be a sign of things to come during the quarterly results given that iPhone sales generate a sizable portion of revenues? This was the theme in the second quarter, with Apple beating on both the top and bottom lines, thanks to 1.5% rise in iPhone sales to $51.33 billion. With Q2 revenue of $94.84 billion, down 3% year over year, this means iPhone sales accounted for 54% of the overall total. This was Apple&#039;s first quarterly revenue drop in almost four years. Apple earned an adjusted EPS of $1.52 which was 8 cents better than estimates. Services revenue, which includes subscriptions to products such as Apple TV+, iCloud storage and Apple Music, rose 5.5% year over year to $20.91 billion, accounting for 22% of revenue. On Thursday investors will be watching closely to see whether (or how) inflation might have impacted spending on Apple’s pricey hardware and how the company guides for the next quarter and full year.

With the aim of decentralizing its supply chain from China, Apple is investing heavily in producing the new iPhone 15 in India.</p><p>What Happened? Apple aims to manufacture 15 million iPhone 15 units in India this year, states a Nikkei report. Previously, India lagged one year behind China in new iPhone production, but in 2022, the gap shrunk to about a month. This year, the aim is to further trim this delay to less than 10 days.</p><p>Historically, China has been responsible for 95% of iPhone production since the debut of the first model in 2007. Now, Apple is looking to shift at least 20% of iPhone 15 production to India, shifting away from the “Assembled in China” tag.</p><p>Apple’s plans for India include not just assembly, but also the creation of intermediate components such as metal casings. In addition, the company wants to migrate some iPhone product development resources from China to India, indicating the potential development of new labs and the involvement of thousands of engineers.</p><p>Why the shift? This shift is fueled by several factors. Firstly, with strained US-China relations and the Biden administration forming closer ties with India, Apple sees potential benefits. Secondly, India, expected to house a billion smartphone users by 2026, could become Apple’s next big market after China.</p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div></div></div><div>  </div><p></p><p>The unveiling of the iPhone 15 is expected next month, and how well India can keep pace with China in a simultaneous launch remains to be seen.

The BoE&#039;s monetary policy committee (MPC) was split on the size of the rate hike. \"This split does leave a sense that the MPC itself is uncertain over what to do,\" said Stuart Cole, chief macro strategist at Equiti Capital, \"and indeed of how much of a danger the UK economy is at risk of being tipped into recession as monetary policy is tightened ever further.\" Wall Street was set to open in negative territory, too. S&amp;P 500 futures ESc1 and Nasdaq futures NQc1 were down 0.2% and 0.4% respectively, set for more pain after a wave of selling a day earlier. Pressuring stocks were a climb in long-term U.S. Treasury yields after stronger-than-expected private employment data and the announced refunding of the U.S. government&#039;s maturing debt. U.S. 10-year yields US10YT=RR hit a new nine-month peak of 4.17%, while 30-year yields US30YT=RR rose to a fresh nine-month top. APPLE AND AMAZON Investors were awaiting earnings results from Apple AAPL.O and Amazon AMZN.O that may give clues on whether the tech sector&#039;s sky-high valuations are justified. Amazon, a bellwether for consumer spending, is expected to report a more than 8% rise in second-quarter revenue, aided by a recovery in the advertising and e-commerce businesses. In Asia, MSCI&#039;s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS fell 0.4%, extending losses after a drop of 2.3% a day earlier. Still, Chinese blue chips .CSI300 rose 0.9% and Hong Kong&#039;s Hang Seng index .HSI added 0.3% after a private survey showed China&#039;s services activity expanded at a faster place in July. Analysts at Morgan Stanley downgraded China shares to equal weight, given the still-negative earnings revisions and weak return on equity and profit margins.

        "title": "5 Reasons US Equity Markets Will Digest Gains Further",
        "content": "<p>The year-to-date returns for the major US Market Index ETFs are as follows: Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ) +44.51% S&amp;P 500 Index ETF (SPY) +20.27% Russell 2000 Index ETF (IWM) +12.56% Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) +6.53% Few investors likely predicted those returns late last year when inflation hit levels not seen in 40-years, geopolitical fears escalated between Russia and Ukraine, and recession fears loomed. However, as is often the case on Wall Street, the stock market is the master manipulator. Whether investors caught the move or not, each is wondering what happens next. Below are five reasons stocks need to digest: Fitch Downgrade US debt was downgraded for the first (and only) time since 2011. Tuesday night, Fitch Rating Agency downgraded US debt from the highest possible rating of AAA+ to AA. While investors only have one data point to go off, in early August of 2011, S&amp;P announced the company’s decision to downgrade US sovereign debt for the first time ever. Over the next few weeks, the S&amp;P 500 corrected nearly 20% Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Wednesday’s 2% Nasdaq decline was the worst hit since February. Though such a rapid decline as 2011 is unlikely, investors should view Wednesday’s action as a warning shot in the short term. Gravity Driven by big-tech and Artificial Intelligence oriented stocks like Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL), The Nasdaq 100 has gone five months without touching the 50-day moving average. Image Source: TradingView Remember, even during the strongest bull markets, valuations begin to matter, profit taking occurs, and markets must recalibrate by correcting through time or price. Furthermore, technicians realize that the 50-day moving average tends to act like a bungy cord – when equity indexes get stretched too far away, a mean-reversion is on the horizon. Overheated Sentiment Whether you use the AAII (American Association of Individual Investors) Sentiment Survey, NAAIM Exposure Index (National Association of Active Investment Managers), or the CNN Fear &amp; Greed Index, sentiment is running hot. For example, until Wednesday, the CNN Fear/Greed Index was at “Extreme Greed” levels for over a month. Image Source: CNN As General George S. Patton once stated, “If everyone is thinking alike, then someone isn’t thinking”. Seasonality Seasonality refers to the tendency for equities to exhibit recurring patterns and behaviors at specific times of the year. Over the past ten years, August and September have been amongst the worst performing months. The magnificent run that equities have had, couples with weaker seasonality trends, should lead us to a broader pullback sooner rather than later. Punishing Stocks Post Earnings Several stocks got punished by double-digits after releasing earnings this week including SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG), Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG), and Generac (GNRC). The poor action in these stocks indicates a character change in the market from previous weeks. What Should Investors Do? · Build a watchlist using relative strength.In other words, in a sea of red, look for green. As the S&amp;P 500 notched new lows in late 2022, stocks like e.l.f Beauty (ELF) and Rambus (RMBS) were notching 52-week highs. · Don’t overtrade. In choppy, light summer trading, it can be easy to suffer from “death by a thousand cuts.” · Wait for the dust to settle.You don’t need to be the first to buy the dip. Wait for proof and interpret, don’t predict. Look for winning stocks like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) to have a higher-time frame rotation (take out a previous weekly high). Zacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock It&#039;s only 1/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom. With strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it&#039;s positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things. Global semiconductor manufacturing is projected to explode from $452 billion in 2021 to $803 billion by 2028.

Undoubtedly, American Express stock was already a tough buy in the face of a potential economic recession. </p> <p>Consumer spending is expected to grind lower in the second half, threatening to drag down the broader basket of payments plays. In any case, I do think the bar has already been lowered quite a bit for American Express going into what’s shaping up to be a headwind-filled couple of quarters. </p> <p>Indeed, travel and entertainment already had its moment to recover from the worst of the pandemic. In that regard, the easy gains already seem to have been made. </p> <p>Regardless, longer-term thinkers still have plenty of reasons to hang onto the stock, even if analysts begin to turn their back on the name. My bull case isn’t just about timing the macro headwinds that may lie ahead. American Express has plenty of intriguing growth levers it may wish to pull as the payments space collides with cutting-edge fintech technologies and AI. </p> <p>For that reason, I’m staying bullish on American Express stock and continue to see it as one of the better value offerings in the market right now.</p>  <p id=\"p_270a3b79e7bf8d2dc4a8ffaa680dfb24\" class=\"img_p\" ><img src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-87.png\" id=\"270a3b79e7bf8d2dc4a8ffaa680dfb24\" onerror=\"javascript: this.parentNode.style.display='none'; \" /></p><p></p>  American Express Stock Slapped with a Downgrade <p>American Express posted a pretty mixed bag for its second quarter. The company beat on earnings (EPS of $2.89 vs. $2.81 estimate) but missed on revenue ($15.05 billion vs. $15.5 billion estimate). The post-earnings reaction was quite negative despite management’s guidance reiteration, which calls for 15-17% revenue growth for the year. Many investors may be feeling the initial chilly breeze of that potentially-looming recession. </p> <p>Piper Sandler’s Kevin Barker slapped the stock with a “Sell,” while slashing AXP’s price target to $149 from $172, implying downside of over 10% from current levels. Barker sees growth and margin pressures at the hands of student loan debt repayments coming due later in the year.</p> <p>Indeed, it’s a notable headwind but one that may be offset by a softer-than-expected landing for the economy. At this pace, a soft landing does seem likely. However, whether the student loan headwinds weigh down AXP stock further remains to be seen.</p> <p>For now, the tough quarter and significant downgrade have made AXP stock that much cheaper, and I’m a fan while shares trade at 16.9 times trailing price-to-earnings, well below the credit services industry average of 22.4 times.</p> Inheriting Apple’s Partnership from Goldman Sachs Could be a Shot in the Arm <p>Just a month ago, a Wall Street Journal report noted investment banking behemoth Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) was looking to offload its Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Card and Savings products, possibly to American Express. Indeed, we haven’t heard anything new about the matter since. </p> <p>Still, one has to view a potential partnership with Apple as a sizeable opportunity to catch up to the likes of its larger credit card and payment peers. Right now, it’s hard to tell if American Express and Apple will form a relationship as Goldman Sachs looks to take a walk. However, the fact that Warren Buffett‘s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) owns a hefty stake in each firm makes such a partnership that much more interesting. </p> <p>Further, Apple’s tech expertise and more than one billion iPhone userbase could come in handy as American Express looks to extend its reach across the U.S. and abroad. </p> <p>For now, an American Express-backed Apple Card doesn’t seem to make a lot of sense, given that it’s not exactly the most accepted credit card in the world. It seems like nearly everybody has an iPhone, but very few folks actually have an American Express card. Still, this could change if American Express takes over for Goldman at some point in the near future.</p> <p>Over the years, American Express has made huge strides regarding acceptance across the U.S. market. Reportedly, around 99% of American merchants now accept American Express cards. Also, if the credit card giant can increase acceptance internationally, possibly with some help from Apple, I do see a scenario where American Express may have a pathway to really close the gap with its credit card peers.</p> Is AXP Stock a Buy, According to Analysts? <p>Turning to Wall Street, AXP stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 13 analyst ratings, there have been five Buys, five Holds, and four Sell recommendations assigned in the past three months.</p> <p>The average American Express stock price target is $178.54, implying upside potential of 7.2%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $125 per share to a high of $203 per share.</p>  <p id=\"p_c88c879bf0f64b08168c9c2e4fb227bf\" class=\"img_p\" ><img src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-86-1024x352.png\" id=\"c88c879bf0f64b08168c9c2e4fb227bf\" onerror=\"javascript: this.parentNode.style.display='none'; \" /></p><p></p>  The Bottom Line on American Express Stock <p>Even if American Express doesn’t end up backing Apple’s financial products, expect the credit card firm to continue staying on its toes on the front of innovation. </p> <p>Indeed, American Express is just another old-school company dabbling with generative AI through its Amex Digital Labs division. Over the next few years, there’s hope that AI innovations could help American Express widen its moat and give its growth a jolt. </p> <p>For now, I think investors and analysts are too nearsighted when it comes to the name following an underwhelming quarter and a remarkable quarterly downgrade from Piper Sandler.</p>  Continue Reading </div> </div> </div></p>"

        "content": "<p>By Echo Wang Aug 3 (Reuters) - The S&amp;P 500.SPX held near the flat line in choppy trade on Thursday afternoon as investors weighed another rise in Treasury yields with the latest batch of economic data and earnings. The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose as high as 4.198% during the session, the highest since November, extending its climb from a day earlier following Fitch&#039;s downgrade of the top-tier U.S. credit rating. “It was a carryover from yesterday&#039;s fear. People who got hit yesterday and didn&#039;t get a chance to get out got out this morning\", said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, \"but then the buyers are showing up. So we&#039;re more greed than fear at this point.” A Labor Department report showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits increased slightly last week, while layoffs dropped to an 11-month low in July as labor market conditions remain tight. Investors were waiting for July&#039;s jobs report, due on Friday. Another report showed the U.S. services sector slowed in July, but businesses faced higher prices for inputs as demand continued to hold up. Richmond Federal Reserve President Thomas Barkin said U.S. inflation remained too high, although recent readings indicated price pressures easing. The Cboe Volatility Index .VIX, Wall Street&#039;s fear gauge, briefly hit a two-month high and was last up at 16.11. After the market close, Apple AAPL.O and Amazon.com AMZN.O are due to report quarterly results. During the session, the iPhone maker slipped 0.5%, while the e-commerce giant added 0.8%. QualcommQCOM.O shares shed 9% after a gloomy forecast signaled more pain for the biggest maker of smartphone chips from the ongoing slump in the consumer electronics market. PayPal HoldingsPYPL.O tumbled 11.5% as investors were disappointed by the payments firm&#039;s quarterly operating margin, even as executives said they expect improvement. U.S. travel stocks fell on downbeat quarterly reports from Spirit Airlines SAVE.N and Expedia EXPE.O that amplified concerns domestic demand may be easing after a strong rebound from pandemic lows. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.64-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.00-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&amp;P 500 posted 14 new 52-week highs and 6 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 54 new highs and 73 new lows.

        "title": "AAPL, AMZN, AMD: Is There More Upside Left in These Buzzing Reddit Stocks?",
        "content": "<p>Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) are among the widely discussed stocks on the social media platform Reddit. While these top technology stocks are buzzing on Reddit and have significantly gained mentions, they have appreciated quite a lot on a year-to-date basis. Despite the rally in their prices, analysts’ average price targets indicate further upside in these stocks. Against this backdrop, let’s delve into these trending Reddit stocks. Can Apple&#039;s Stock Keep Going Up? Apple stock has gained about 47.56% year-to-date. However, its stock is down over 2% in after-hours trading following its third-quarter financial results. Though its earnings came ahead of the Street’s projection, the decline in sales of the iPhone, iPad, and Mac didn’t go well with investors. The decline in sales reflects tough year-over-year comparisons and macro uncertainty. Nonetheless, its Services revenue reached $21.2 billion, driven by more than one billion paid subscriptions. Following Q3 earnings, Goldman Sachs analyst Mike Ng reiterated a Buy recommendation on Apple stock on August 3. The analyst said that “certain elements of F3Q23 results were disappointing vs. Consensus.” Nevertheless, the company’s growing installed base of paid subscriptions will drive “secular growth in Services” and support its premium valuation. Overall, Apple stock has received 24 Buy and seven Hold recommendations for a Strong Buy consensus rating. Analysts’ average price target of $203.64 implies 6.52% upside potential from current levels. Is Amazon Stock Expected to Rise? Amazon stock has gained over 53% year-to-date. Further, the stock is up about 8.73% in after-hours trading following its solid second-quarter results. AMZN Q2 earnings crushed Wall Street’s estimates. Meanwhile, analysts’ average price target indicates that Amazon stock could rise more. The increase in the e-commerce business, led by macro improvement and cost reduction measures, supported AMZN’s Q2 performance. Moreover, signs of stabilization in the cloud business (AWS) and ongoing momentum in its advertising segment position it well to deliver solid growth in the coming quarters. Eric Sheridan of Goldman Sachs maintained his bullish view of Amazon stock following Q2 earnings results. The analyst expects the company to benefit from improving margins in the e-commerce business. Further, the ongoing digital transformation will support its AWS segment. At the same time, Amazon will also benefit from the growing scale of its advertising business. Along with Sheridan, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik, and Nicholas Jones of JMP Securities reiterated the Buy rating on AMZN stock following Q2 financial results. Amazon stock has received a Buy recommendation from all 29 analysts who have recently rated it. Collectively, their 12-month average price target of $86.20 implies an upside of nearly 16%. What is the Future of AMD Stock? Shares of Advanced Micro Devices will likely benefit from the solid demand for chips that power AI (Artificial Intelligence) applications. At the same time, the recovery in PC demand will support its financials, in turn, its stock. AMD recently delivered better-than-expected earnings. The company’s management expects the PC market to grow in the second half of 2023, which is encouraging. Additionally, the growing AI deployments in the data center market augur well for growth. As AI presents a multibillion-dollar growth opportunity for the company, Tristan Gerra of Robert W. Baird reiterated a Buy on AMD stock on August 1. The analyst expects AMD’s gross margins to expand significantly in 2024, led by “the ramp of AI” and easier year-over-year comparisons in the Embedded segment (which includes embedded CPUs and GPUs). Overall, AMD stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating on TipRanks, reflecting 25 Buy and six Hold recommendations. Analysts’ average price target of $142.51 implies 25.95% upside potential. The Bottom Line AAPL, AMZN, and AMD stocks are trending on Reddit and have multiple growth engines to drive their stock prices higher. In addition, analysts’ Strong Buy consensus rating supports the bull case. As these stocks appear to be attractive long-term bets, Wall Street analysts’ average price targets show that AMD offers the highest upside potential.

        "title": "European stocks stabilise ahead of US payrolls data",
        "content": "<p>By Sruthi Shankar Aug 4 (Reuters) - European stocks steadied on Friday, after a recent selloff, as strong results from retail giant Amazon and a host of other companies outweighed recent jitters around slowing economic growth across the continent. The pan-European STOXX 600 index .STOXX edged up 0.1% after shedding about 3% in the past three sessions. Wall Street futures also rose as a strong forecast from Amazon.com IncAMZN.O outweighed a downbeat sales outlook from iPhone maker AppleAAPL.O. The focus largely was on U.S. payrolls data, due at 1230 GMT, which is expected to show job growth likely slowed further in July but retained enough momentum to shield the economy from a recession. \"Having just come off the back of another 25 basis points rate hike from the Federal Reserve last week and what may well be the final rate hike of this cycle, the U.S. payrolls data is likely to continue to showcase the resilience of the U.S. economy,\" Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said in a note. Stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic have rallied in recent weeks, driven by signs of resilience in the U.S. economy and hopes that major central banks are near the end of their monetary tightening cycle. However, weak data out of Europe and Asia and the surprise downgrade on the U.S. credit rating set the STOXX 600 for its first weekly loss in four. Earnings were a mixed bag in Europe. French lender Credit AgricoleCAGR.PA climbed 5.7% as strong insurance and consumer finance results helped it report upbeat quarterly earnings. Italy&#039;s state-owned bank Monte dei Paschi di SienaBMPS.MI jumped 3.0% as it posted above-forecast earnings for the second quarter. Dragging media shares down, WPPWPP.L, the world&#039;s biggest advertising group, slid 7.1% after it downgraded its full-year like-for-like growth forecast. VonoviaVNAn.DE slipped 2.5% as Germany&#039;s largest real estate group slipped to a 2 billion euro ($2.19 billion) second-quarter loss and wrote down the value of its properties by 3 billion euros. Among the STOXX 600 companies that have reported so far, 56% have beaten analysts&#039; profit estimates, as per Refinitiv IBES data. In a typical quarter, 54% top estimates. Citi strategists upgraded their earnings outlook for 2024, saying \"soft landing\" scenarios look plausible and that economically sensitive cyclical sectors should benefit the most.

        "title": "Helped By Strong Services Growth, Apple Earnings Just Returned to Growth",
        "content": "<p>Though Apple&#039;s (NASDAQ: AAPL) top line in its fiscal third quarter was down 1% year over year, there was a lot to like about the quarter. Not only was this a narrower year-over-year decline than the previous quarter, but sales were better than management had anticipated and ahead of analysts&#039; average forecast. Perhaps even more important, Apple returned to earnings growth, as earnings per share came in significantly ahead of analysts&#039; consensus view for the profitability metric. Stealing the show for the quarter was Apple&#039;s services segment, which grew substantially year over year and came in at a record quarterly high. Here&#039;s a closer look at the results -- and why the quarter&#039;s performance should be viewed as a reason for shareholders to keep betting on the iPhone-maker&#039;s shares. Robust results in a challenging market Revenue was down 1% year over year despite a 4 percentage point headwind from foreign exchange. This was an improvement from a 3% year-over-year decline last quarter. Further, it&#039;s a solid result, given a challenging smartphone market in the U.S. Management said in Apple&#039;searnings callthat weak iPhone revenue in the U.S. weighed on revenue in its Americas region, which declined almost 6% year over year. As the company&#039;s biggest geographical segment, this held back the company&#039;s top line. Despite softness in Apple&#039;s Americas segment, the report included many other bright spots. First and foremost, services revenue grew 8% year over year and increased by a double-digit year-over-year rate in constant currency, according to comments from Apple chief financial officer Luca Maestri during the company&#039;s fiscal third-quarterearnings call Capturing the segment&#039;s momentum, this growth rate was an acceleration, compared to 5% year-over-year revenue growth in fiscal Q2. Importantly, management said it expects further acceleration in the company&#039;s reported services revenue growth rate in fiscal Q4. Thanks to strength outside of the Americas for the iPhone, the product segment&#039;s sales actually increased year over year on a constant-currency basis -- a testament to the resilience of Apple&#039;s biggest product line. However, iPhone revenue fell 2% year over year on a reported basis. Greater China&#039;s performance is also worth calling out. The important market returned to growth in the quarter, with sales rising 8% year over year. This compares to a 3% year-over-year decline in Greater China revenue in fiscal Q2. Perhaps most important of all was the fact that Apple returned to earnings growth. Earnings per share rose 5% year over year to $1.26. This starkly contrasts with a 3% year-over-year decline in earnings per share last quarter. Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings per share of $1.21. Results worthy of the stock&#039;s valuation Overall, the results helped justify the stock&#039;s current valuation. A return to year-over-year earnings growth, revenue growth on a constant-currency basis, and management&#039;s comments about expecting improved year-over-year performance for both services and iPhone on a reported basis in fiscal Q4 are all reasons for shareholders to be pleased with the report. While the stock isn&#039;t cheap with a price-to-earnings ratio of about 32, Apple&#039;s resilient business in a difficult environment demonstrates why the stock is worth holding onto for the long haul. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The last date to apply for the so-called production-linked incentives in this product category is Aug. 30.</p> <p>The action is also intended to curb imports of these goods from countries like China and South Korea, NDTV reported citing news agency Press Trust of India.</p> <p>Laptop makers had been bracing for some government action, however the sudden licensing imposition has caught the industry off-guard, the Bloomberg report added citing people with knowledge of the matter.</p> <p>Companies are now engaging with the government on how to quickly get licenses, ahead of festival seasons in the coming months, according to the sources. It is not clear how long it will take for the companies to get licenses, but the halt is already disrupting a multibillion-dollar trade in foreign PCs.</p> <p>These requirements may pose additional hurdles for manufacturers who are already facing global excess inventory and triggers to restart sales growth.

Here’s What You Need To Know</p><p>During the call, Cook emphasized the integral role of AI and machine learning in Apple’s product ecosystem. </p><p>He cited examples of recent innovations showcased at the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference, such as Personal Voice and Live Voicemail, which were made possible by AI advancements. </p><p>He also mentioned previously announced life-saving features like fall detection, crash detection, and ECG, all of which relied on the power of AI and machine learning.</p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div></div></div><p>“None of these features that I just mentioned and many, many more would be possible without AI and machine learning.

        "content": "<p>For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click LIVE/ or type LIVE/ in a news window. Futures up: Dow 0.24%, S&amp;P 0.46%, Nasdaq 0.63% Aug 4 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Friday as Amazon&#039;s better-than-expected earnings trumped Apple&#039;s tepid sales forecast, while investors awaited the July jobs report to firm up the likelihood of a \"soft landing\" for the economy. Amazon shares AMZN.O surged 8.8% in premarket trading after the company issued an upbeat outlook for the third quarter, while Apple&#039;s shares AAPL.O fell 1.8% as the iPhone maker forecast a continued slide in sales. Shares of peers Microsoft MSFT.O, Alphabet GOOGL.O and Snowflake SNOW.K rose between 1% and 6.2% after Amazon&#039;s cloud business segment beat sales estimates. All eyes will be squarely on the July U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, due at 8:30 a.m. ET, with a Reuters poll of economists estimating payrolls increased by 200,000 jobs last month, after having risen 209,000 in June, showing labor market conditions remain tight. A Labor Department report on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits increased slightly last week, while layoffs dropped to an 11-month low in July. \"The U.S. economy still appears to be in decent shape, concern about the manufacturing sector notwithstanding, but the services sector has remained resilient, with another solid ISM survey in July which saw prices paid tick higher, and the employment component tick lower,\" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. \"The resilience in the prices paid component feeds into the concern that rates are likely to remain higher for longer.\" The yield on the 10-year benchmark note was steady near the nine-month high it hit due, partly, to Fitch downgrading the United States from a AAA rating to AA+ earlier this week. Stocks closed marginally lower on Thursday weighed down by the latest batch of economic data and earnings downgrades. At 05:25 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were up 83 points, or 0.24%, S&amp;P 500 e-minis EScv1 were up 20.75 points, or 0.46%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were up 97 points, or 0.63%. Tupperware TUP.N shot up 55.4% in premarket trading after it finalized an agreement with its lenders to restructure its debt obligations in an effort to turn around its business. Amgen AMGN.O was up 1.1%, although in low volumes after it reported a higher quarterly profit on strong sales of its cholesterol, osteoporosis and other drugs. Its planned acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics HZPN.O is delayed due to regulatory scrutiny. Sports-betting firm DraftKings DKNG.O shares surged 13.7% after it raised its fiscal year 2023 revenue guidance.

        "title": "Amazon surges on 'game-changing' quarter, iPhone slump drags Apple",
        "content": "<p>By Aditya Soni Aug 4 (Reuters) - Amazon.com shares AMZN.O surged 9% on Friday on signs that both its growth engines, e-commerce and cloud-computing, were faring well in an uncertain economy, helping shield the broader market from Apple&#039;s AAPL.O 1.5% slide after gloomy iPhone sales. The reports capped what has been a positive earnings season for most big U.S. tech firms from Google-owner Alphabet to Meta, thanks to a pick-up in the digital ad market and improving demand for cloud services after a nearly year-long slump. Online retail giant Amazon was set to add about $120 billion to its market value, based on premarket movements. Meanwhile Apple, the world&#039;s most valuable firm, was on course to slide below $3 trillion, with a $50 billion drop in its valuation. The better-than-expected performance of Amazon&#039;s cloud business in the second quarter also lifted other members of the coveted trillion-dollar club, with Microsoft MSFT.O and Alphabet GOOGL.O both rising more than 1%. Wall Street analysts said Amazon&#039;s estimate-beating quarterly profit and sales showed that both its key businesses can grow together after two years of \"unpleasant surprises\". \"The second quarter is a game-changing quarter for Amazon; we would call it an-all clear moment,\" said SVB MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Morton. \"Retail and AWS (Amazon Web Services) are working together. No more handwringing on retail losses or AWS optimization, but rather &#039;how high can retail margins go&#039; and &#039;when can we see the benefit of artificial intelligence at AWS?&#039;\" At least 17 analysts raised their price targets on the stock, pushing the median view to $154, according to Refinitiv data. That&#039;san upside of nearly 20% to a stock that has already risen almost 50% this year. Amazon has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 58.78, much higher than Apple&#039;s 29.5 and the industry median of 14.87. The iPhone maker warned on Thursday that it was headed for the fourth straight quarter of declining sales as demand continues to slow for its flagship device, especially in developed markets. But its services business was a bright spot and helped Apple top profit expectations for the June quarter. \"The services arm provides a welcome cushion to the group, but Apple still needs to revive hardware sales growth otherwise the market is going to worry about the next generation of customers to join its ecosphere,\" said Dan Coatsworth, stock market analyst at AJ Bell. \"It is time for Apple to launch something new and innovative, not just another variation of its core products.\" (Reporting by Aditya Soni and Samrhitha Arunasalam in Bengaluru and Joice Alves in London; Editing by Amanda Cooper and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty) ((Joice.Alves@thomsonreuters.com; Twitter @joiceal;)) The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.</p>"

The Nasdaq Technology Index (US100) closed negative by 0.10%.</p><p>The monthly Nonfarm Payrolls labor market report will be released in the United States today. Over the past year, economists have consistently underestimated the strength of the economy, leading to a repeated underestimation of employment gains. Given this pattern and forecast bias, it is reasonable to believe that the NFP numbers could surprise upward again. The latest labor market data this week was mixed. On the one hand, job openings and jobless claims rose, indicating the first signs of a cooling labor market. On the other hand, the ADP report was strong, exceeding the consensus forecast by two times. Therefore, today&#039;s NFP data could be crucial in understanding where the US labor market stands.</p><p>The US Services Business Activity Index fell to 52.7 in July from June&#039;s reading of 53.9, as business activity, employment, and new orders declined and prices rose. The services sector has the biggest impact on assessing the health of the US economy, so changes in subsections of the report could indicate the future direction of the economy.</p><p>Amazon (AMZN) released second-quarter results on Thursday that beat analysts&#039; estimates and provided an upbeat outlook for the third quarter. Amazon shares were up more than 6% in after-hours trading following the report. Qualcomm (QCOM) shares fell more than 8% after the company provided a weak outlook for the current quarter, with revenue falling short of Wall Street estimates. On Thursday, Apple (AAPL) reported third-quarter results that beat forecasts as strength in services helped offset iPhone sales that fell short of expectations. Apple shares were down by 1% in trading following the report.</p><p>Equity markets in Europe were declining yesterday. Germany&#039;s DAX (DE40) was down by 0.79%, France&#039;s CAC 40 (FR40) fell by 0.72%, Spain&#039;s IBEX 35 (ES35) lost 0.39%, and the UK&#039;s FTSE 100 (UK100) closed negative by 0.43%.</p><p>The Bank of England (BoE) expectedly raised interest rates by 0.25% yesterday. The distribution of votes changed slightly from the previous decision: 7 Committee representatives were in favor of a rate hike, and only one was in favor of keeping the rate unchanged (previously 2). Meanwhile, representatives Haskel and Mann favored a 0.5% rate hike, indicating the desire of some Bank policymakers to pursue aggressive monetary policy. Core inflation was cited as the most important aspect of inflation, which has yet to show a significant decline, while a decision on quantitative tightening (QT) measures will be made next month.</p><p>Saudi Arabia announced on Thursday that it would extend its production cuts in August and September by one million barrels per day.

        "content": "<p><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div> <p>For much of 2023, strength in big-cap technology stocks has kept the market in a steady uptrend. There has been substantial outperformance in seven or so stocks leveraged to the development of artificial intelligence. Still, those stocks also have helped to pull up the broader market as they have created optimism about the economy and equities.</p> <div></div> <p>However, there has been some shifting in market conditions in the past week, and now with the earnings from Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) out, most of the earnings season is over as we head for the weakest month of the year, which is September. There is one more big report due from Nvidia (NVDA) in a few weeks, but after that there are no earnings catalysts, which is part of the reason that September tends to be soft.</p> <div></div> <p>The earnings from Amazon were better than expected, and the stock is indicated to open about 9% higher here on Friday. The question here is whether the stock can gain momentum. When Alphabet GOOGL reported on July 26, it gapped up about 5%, but it is trading at almost the exact same level seven trading sessions later.</p> <div></div> <p>Apple disappointed and is trading about 2% and is sitting at its 50-day simple moving average. It has not traded below that level since January of this year. Apple is a stock that is often viewed as a safe haven and is likely to attract dip buyers regardless of concerns about its valuation.</p> <div></div> <p>This morning CITI notes that, on average, Apple is up 8% in the period following June earnings and into the next iPhone announcement. During that period, Apple has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 each time, which illustrates how the stock often serves as a safe haven during a period of weak seasonality.</p> <div></div> <p>We&#039;ll see how these two stocks develop from here, but the bigger issue is whether the character of the market action will shift. We are seeing some toppy action, but the bears have been incapable of generating any sustained downside momentum for a while. Economic news and earnings have provided plenty of ammunition for the bulls, but both those areas are in flux now in conjunction with seasonality.</p> <div></div> <p>We still have many small-cap earnings reports that will create speculative action in small stocks, but the bigger trends in bonds are having a substantial impact on sentiment and are causing re-evaluation of the market.</p> <div></div> <p>My game plan is to play some of the small-cap earnings names on earnings, but I&#039;ll be watching Apple as it develops from here. The bears tend to place too much focus on Apple&#039;s valuation and fail to recognize that this is a stock that is often viewed as a place to park cash when market conditions become more difficult.</p> <div></div> <p>(AAPL and AMZN are holdings of Action Alerts PLUS.

European markets are mixed in midday trading and U.S. equity futures point to a positive market open later this morning led by post-earnings gains in Amazon (AMZN) shares, which account for 3.0% of the S&amp;P 500 and 5.1% of the Nasdaq-100. Before the market opens, investors will be reviewing another key piece of July economic data, looking for further support for the soft-landing narrative that has been driving the market. Amid growing optimism about the economic outlook, this week Bank of America (BAC) became the first large Wall Street bank to officially reverse its call for a recession. At 8:30 AM ET, the Labor Department will release the July Employment Report, which is expected to show nonfarm payrolls grew by 200,000 during the month after adding 209,000 in the prior one. Wage data in the report is expected to show average hourly earnings up 4.2%, down from 4.4% the prior three months. Following the upside surprise in ADP’s July National Employment Report on Wednesday, stronger than anticipated data in the Employment Report may push back on the market’s view the Fed’s July rate hike was its last. To the extent the economy is stronger than previously thought we could see renewed questions as to when the Fed may deliver its first rate cut. As of now, data from the CME FedWatch Tool puts that timing between the Fed’s March and May 2024 policy meetings. Data Download International Economy Factory orders in Germany unexpectedly rose by 7% month-over-month in June, easily exceeding market estimates of a 2% fall and accelerating from the downwardly revised +6.2% figure in May. Retail sales in the Euro Area went down 0.3% MoM in June after a revised +0.6% in May, missing the market consensus forecast for +0.2%. On a YoY basis, June retail sales in the Euro Area fell 1.4%, better than the expected reading of -1.7% and May’s -2.4%. Ahead of OPEC+ ministers meeting today to review the oil market, Saudi Arabia said it will extend a voluntary oil output cut of one million barrels per day (bpd) for a third month to include September, adding it could be extended beyond that or deepened. Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said Russia would cut oil exports by 300,000 bpd in September. Domestic Economy As we laid about above, market watchers will be focused on this morning’s July Employment report, noting the pace of job creation during the month but also wage inflation and what that could mean for Fed monetary policy expectations. Markets Stocks continued to trade off yesterday although not as aggressively as Wednesday as Treasury yields ticked higher. The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.10%, the Dow gave back 0.19%, the S&amp;P 500 slid 0.25% and the Russell 2000 closed 0.28% lower. Sectors were mostly lower with Utilities taking the biggest lump, down 2.28% followed by Real Estate which fell 1.37%. While the U.S. credit downgrade had some impact on sentiment, concerns about China&#039;s weakness and mixed forward guidance this earning season is starting to creep into the near-term outlook. Energy was the only bright spot as the sector rallied 1.01% on oil prices firming at $80 per barrel. In individual names, shares of covid era darling Clorox were bid up 8.96% after posting estimates beating revenues and EPS and guiding higher-than-expected 2024 results, prompting several analyst firms to raise price targets as well as ratings.

Amazon (AMZN) crushed earnings, posting EPS of $0.65 as compared to the consensus estimate of $0.35, and handily beat revenue expectations by reporting quarterly revenues of $134.4 billion versus estimates of $131.5 billion. Amazon Web Services (AWS) saw sales rise 12% YoY to $22.14 billion as margins declined roughly 5% to 24.2% as compared to the same period in 2022. Advertising Services revenue grew +22% to $10.68 billion, coming in slightly lower than the 23% growth seen in Q1 2023 and Q4 2022. The company gave upside guidance for Q3 revenues at $138-$143 billion compared to estimates of $138.36 billion. The company stated that “AWS has continued to add to its meaningful leadership position in the cloud with a slew of generative AI releases that make it much easier and more cost-effective for companies to train and run models, customize Large Language Models to build generative AI applications and agents, and write code much more efficiently.” The company went on to talk about how Advertising Services sees a strong fall as Thursday Night Football advertisers will be able to tailor audience-specific, and interactive ad packages. Apple’s (AAPL) latest quarterly earnings came in $0.06 better than estimates at $1.26 per share while revenues came in line with expectations despite falling 1.4% YoY. iPhone sales ($39.7 billion) accounted for just over half of the company’s roughly $82 billion in revenues, Services provided about 25% of the total while Mac, iPad, and Wearables combined to round out the balance. CEO Tim Cook commented that headwinds in advertising and gaming have flipped to become tailwinds and that the company “saw continued strength in emerging markets thanks to robust sales of iPhone\" and went on to say that the “installed base of active devices reached an all-time high in every geographic segment.\" Next quarter guidance included comments that pointed to flat revenue on a YoY basis, a 2% impact due to F/X, acceleration of the Services business, and gross margins remaining in the mid-40 % range. Fortinet (FTNT) reported latest quarter earnings of $0.38 per share, coming in $0.04 ahead of analyst estimates while revenues came in line at $1.29 billion, a 25.5% YoY increase. The company guided next quarter&#039;s EPS between $0.35 to $0.37 in line with estimates of $0.36 and revenues between $1.315 and 1.375, slightly below estimates of $1.8 billion. Full fiscal year 2023 guidance saw forecasted EPS rising $0.05 from the previous estimate and revenues declining slightly to $5.35 to $5.45 billion as compared to the $5.47 estimate. Cloudflare (NET) beat EPS estimates, reporting earnings of $0.10 per share, and exceeded revenue expectations by $3 million, coming in at $308.5 million after a 31% YoY increase. The company issued upside guidance for revenues and EPS for the next quarter and the rest of fiscal year 2023. Airbnb (ABNB) reported quarterly earnings of $0.98 per share, beating estimates by $0.18 while also beating revenue estimates after a YoY 18% increase to $2.48 billion as compared to the $4.42 consensus.

        "title": "GLOBAL MARKETS-World stocks set for worst week since March; US payrolls in focus",
        "content": "<p>By Amanda Cooper and Elizabeth Howcroft LONDON, Aug 4 (Reuters) - European stocks indexes fell on Friday, while the dollar headed for a third weekly gain as investors assessed U.S. economic data that largely showed a resilient labour market ahead of the all-important monthly jobs report. The MSCI All-World index .MIWD00000PUS was flat on the day at 1123 GMT and headed for its biggest weekly drop in five months, thanks in part to a surge in government bond yields this week after more data pointed to slowing inflation and the prospect of a deluge of U.S. Treasury supply. Investor attention will be squarely on the July U.S. non-farm payrolls report, with a Reuters survey of 80 economists expecting payrolls to have increased by 200,000 last month, after rising 209,000 in June. Economists who have long been forecasting a downturn by the fourth quarter of this year are increasingly becoming convinced that the \"soft-landing\" scenario for the economy envisaged by the U.S. Federal Reserve is now possible. \"Today’s U.S. payrolls data is likely to continue to showcase the resilience of the U.S. economy,\" Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said in a note. Data showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit rose slightly last week, while layoffs dropped to an 11-month low in July as labour market conditions remained tight. The STOXX 600 was down 0.3% on the day .STOXX, while London&#039;s FTSE 100 .FTSE and Germany&#039;s DAX were both down 0.4% .GDAXI. Futures on the S&amp;P 500 EScv1 and on the Nasdaq 100 NQc1 both gained 0.2%, suggesting earnings from technology bellwethers could give the index a boost later on. Amazon AMZN.Oreported sales growth and profit that beat analyst estimates, while Apple AAPL.Oforecast a sales slump to continue into the current quarter. The benchmark indices closed little changed the previous day after a choppy trading session, as investors weighed up the implications of rising Treasury yields along with the latest batch of economic data and earnings. \"It’s a very fragile market,\" said Francesco Sandrini, head of multi-asset strategy at Amundi. \"The market is quite nervous at the moment, the very low volatility that has been prevailing so far now is facing a reality check.\" The dollar meanwhile rose 0.1% against a basket of major currencies =USD, heading for its third weekly gain in a row. It has made the most headway against some of this year&#039;s better-performing currencies, such as the Australian dollar AUD=D3, which lost 1.5% this week, or the poundGBP=D3, which is heading for a drop of 1.2% after the Bank of England delivered a smaller rate rise than many had hoped for. China&#039;s yuan CNH=D3, which is set for a 0.6% loss this week against the dollar, gained some respite after an official said on Friday the central bank would use policy tools flexibly to ensure reasonably ample liquidity in the banking system. Investors have been hoping policymakers will deliver more broad-based stimulus to boost the post-pandemic recovery as the world&#039;s second-largest economy struggles with weak demand at home and abroad. Further support for the U.S. dollar came from the Treasury market, where 10-year yields US10YT=RR held steady around nine-month highs, at 4.19%, while 30-year bond yields hovered at 4.28% US30YT=RR, set for their biggest weekly rise this year. Rating agency Fitch this week surprised markets by stripping the United States of its prized triple-A credit rating and cited the country&#039;s deteriorating fiscal position as one of the key drivers, thrusting the government&#039;s finances into the spotlight. Earlier in the week, the U.S. Treasury said it expects to borrow just over $1 trillion in the third quarter of this year alone, $273 billion more than its May estimate. Oil prices headed for a sixth straight weekly gain, driven up by the prospect of reduced supply from Saudi Arabia and Russia. U.S. crude CLc1 rose 0.3% to $81.81 a barrel, while Brent LCOc1 rose 0.4% to $85.44.

        "content": "<p><div> <div> <div></div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <p>Icahn Enterprises L.P.’s stock tumbled 30% on Friday, after the company said it’s cutting its quarterly distribution to $1 from $2 previously. </p> <p>The company IEP,  -23.23%  made the announcement as it reported a surprise quarterly loss with Chairman Carl Icahn, the billionaire activist investor, blaming the news squarely on one thing.</p> <div> <p>“I believe the second quarter partially reflected the impact of short selling on companies we control or invest in, which I attribute to the misleading and self-serving Hindenburg report concerning our company, “Icahn said in a statement. </p> <p>“It also reflected the size of the hedge book relative to our activist strategy.” </p> <p>Icahn was referring to a report by short seller Hindenburg Research published on May 2 that accused IEP, Icahn’s publicly traded investing arm, of overstating asset values. Hindenburg also revealed that Icahn himself had borrowed from the company, among other issues.</p> <p>That had been disclosed in a footnote to financials that Wall Street had overlooked. </p> <p>Read: What we know about Carl Icahn’s margin loan</p> <p>See also: Carl Icahn rebuts short seller Hindenburg Research’s report. It’s already cost his company $6 billion in market cap.</p> <p>The report shaved billions off IEP’s market cap and was firmly rebutted by Icahn, who recently said he has finalized amended loan agreements with banks that untie his personal loans from the trading price of his company’s shares.</p> <p> Icahn said IEP has paid out distributions for 73 continuous quarters and does not intend for a “misleading” report to interfere with that practice. </p> <div></div> <p>“The payment of future distributions will be determined by the board of directors quarterly, based upon current economic conditions and business performance and other factors that it deems relevant at the time that declaration of a distribution is considered,” said Icahn.</p> <p>On a call with analysts, IEP’s Chief Executive David Willetts highlighted the long-term “lumpiness” of the business, given its many moving parts. </p> <p>“We have large wins at times and we have volatility, we’re not a company that necessarily has predictable cash flow, there are no guarantees,” he told analysts. </p> <p>But IEP is not changing its strategy on distributions, he added.</p> <p>The stock was headed for the biggest one-day selloff since it went public 36 years ago. The next biggest drop was 20.0% on May 2, when the Hindenburg Research report was released.</p> <p>The company, which is 84% owned by Icahn and his son, Brett, offers exposure to Icahn’s personal portfolio of public and private companies, including petroleum refineries, car-parts makers, food-packaging companies and real estate. Its unit holders are mostly retail investors.</p> <p>The fund has performed poorly in the past decade. For many years Icahn has publicly expressed suspicion of the bull market that raged around him. He shorted the stock market in a big way as a hedge against his long activist positions. Going into 2021, for example, Icahn’s investment fund had a short exposure of 142%, SEC filings show.</p> <p>For more, see: Carl Icahn admits he was wrong to take a huge short position on the market that lost $9 billion</p> <p>Hindenburg, the short selling firm founded by Nate Anderson, took a victory lap on Elon Musk’s X platform, the renamed Twitter, noting that it had predicted that IEP’s poor investment performance would eventually force it to cut the distribution.</p> <div> <div>      </div> </div> <p>Icahn has himself waged endless activist campaigns against companies and their management teams, and most recently succeeded in his effort to shake up management at gene sequencing test maker Illumina Inc. ILMN,  +1.26%  </p> <p>In June, that company accepted the resignation of its Chief Executive and director, Francis DeSouza, ending a monthslong heated battle over its $7.1 billion acquisition of cancer test maker Grail that has faced regulatory hurdles, as the Associated Press reported. </p> <p>Icahn had urged shareholders to vote out its chairman, John Thompson, and DeSouza. Company shareholders voted out Thompson in late May.</p> <p>Past activist campaigns by Icahn’s company have generated billions of dollars for shareholders and helped boards and CEOs capture untapped value, Icahn has argued, citing Reynolds, Netflix NFLX,  +0.14% , Forest Labs, Apple AAPL,  -4.80% , CVR Energy CVI,  -0.98% , Herbalife  eBay , Tropicana, Cheniere LNG,  -0.95%  and Occidental OXY,  +2.11%  as examples.</p> <p>IEP said it had a loss of $269 million, or 72 cents per depositary unit, for the second quarter, wider than the loss of $128 million, or 41 cents per depositary unit, posted in the year-earlier period.</p> <p>Revenue fell to $2.684 billion from $3.796 billion.</p> <p>The FactSet consensus was for income of 25 cents per depositary unit and revenue of $2.657 billion. </p> <p>Meanwhile, investors are waiting to see the outcome  and other issues, which was disclosed along with first-quarter earnings.</p> <p>IEP’s stock is down 35% in the year to date, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX has gained 18%. </p> </div></p>"

        "content": "<p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div><p>Together with Amazon.com Inc AMZN, Apple Inc AAPL reported its fiscal third quarter earnings on Thursday. Although it topped both sales and earnings expectations like Amazon, shares fell 2% upon the report during extended trading as Apple did not provide any guidance due to uncertainty after a third consecutive quarter of declining sales. On the other hand, Amazon shares surged more than 7% after hours and continued to so in premarket trading on Friday, but Amazon did not only squash estimates but also provided a strong outlook fueled by its biggest yet Prime Day event that took place in July. </p>Apple&#039;s Fiscal Third Quarter Highlights<p>For the quarter ended on July 1st, sales still fell 1% YoY despite service revenue growing 8% YoY. Total revenue amounted to $81.8 billion, beating Refinitiv’s estimate of $81.69 billion. Earnings per share rose 5% to $1.26, topping analyst expectations of $1.19 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Gross margin of 44.5% topped Refinitiv’s 44.2% estimate.</p><p>iPhones brought in $39.67 billion to the revenue table, below Refinitiv’s consensus estimate of $39.91 billion as iPhone sales contracted 2%.</p><p>Mac revenue was down 7% as it amounted to $6.84 billion, surpassing Refinitiv’s consensus estimate of $6.62 billion.</p><p>iPad revenue contracted as much as 20% as it amounted to $5.79 billion, far below Refinitiv’s $6.41 billion consensus estimate.</p><p>Other Products revenue that includes wearables such as Apple Watch and AirPods rose 2% as it brought in $8.28 billion, but coming in below the estimated $8.39 billion.</p><p>Last but certainly not least, service revenue that was also the highlight of the report, rose 8% YoY to $21.21 billion, topping the estimated $20.76 billion. Apple is said to now have 1 billion subscribers on its platform, which includes both Apple services and third-party apps, rising from 975 million subscribers it reported for the previous quarter.</p><p>Like its Big Tech peers, Apple ramped up its AI spending, with research and development costs coming up to $22.61 billion for the fiscal year so far, which is $3.12 billion higher compared to last year’s comparable period. But, AI is still not showing any visible gains, but this is even the case for Amazon and its AWS unit as both companies continue experimenting with ways in which this developing technology can enhance their products and consumer experiences.</p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div></div></div>Beating The Odds In China<p>Apple’s sales in China grew 8% YoY and what is interesting is that Apple seems to have outperformed what has been the weakest smartphone market in the country in almost a decade. Counterpoint Research reported that overall smartphone sales in the country contracted 8% but Apple CEO Tim Cook informed investors that iPhone sales in China grew by \"double digits” with other segments also reporting high sales. Apple got $15.76 billion in revenue from the greater China region with sales expanding from $14.60 billion recorded during last year’s comparable quarter, it generated. Besides new iPhone owners, Cook also revealed the company set quarterly records wearables, home and accessories, and services in the world&#039;s greatest market.</p><div><div></div></div>Official Outlook Was Absent<p>Although an official guidance was not given due to macroeconomic uncertainty, the tech giant reflected on its views for the undergoing quarter with only the gross margin being said to be expected between 44 and 45% with OpEx in the range from $13.5 and $13.7 billion.</p><p> CFO Luca Maestri said the September quarter revenue is expected to decline with performance anticipated to be similar to the June quarter. This implies that the sales forecast falls below analyst expectations of roughly flat fiscal fourth-quarter sales of $90.19 billion that Refinitiv’s survey of analysts were expecting. iPads and Macs revenue is expected to drop by double-digit percentages but iPhone sales are expected to do better and the already strong growth rate of Apple’s Services unit is expected to rise further. Therefore, the unofficial outlook can be summed up as similar to the latest reported quarter, but hopefully slightly better.</p>Apple Finds Itself In A Delicate Position<p>Apple will continue facing the struggling smartphone market with iPhone having to fight for market share against its Android rivals, while its next big product that is expected to push the boundaries of its existing business model, Vision Pro mixed-reality headset, still hasn’t reached consumers. Therefore, the world is waiting to see Apple’s new way of ‘enriching’ the lives of its consumers while Big Tech enters a new chapter, one that will undoubtedly be powered by generative AI.</p><p>DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "<p>Warren Buffett is one of the greatest business minds in American history. Under his leadership, Berkshire Hathaway stock compounded at 20% annually for nearly six decades, growing twice as fast as the S&amp;P 500. Very few companies ever achieve that rate of success, and much of the credit goes to Buffett and his ability to identify rewarding investments. Indeed, Buffett engineered dozens of savvy acquisitions over the years, and he helped Berkshire build a $328 billion equity investment portfolio. But investors may be surprised to learn that a single stock accounts for 46% of that total. Berkshire had $151 billion invested in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) as of the March quarter. Apple is one of seven companies that have recently been dubbed the \"Magnificent Seven\" by Wall Street. The others are listed below: Microsoft Alphabet Amazon Nvidia Tesla Meta Platforms The truly magnificent thing about the Magnificent Seven is the wealth they have created for shareholders. Those seven companies are collectively worth more than $11 trillion, and Apple is the largest of the bunch with a market cap of $3 trillion. Yet, Berkshire has never sold a single share of Apple stock, implying that the company and Buffett see plenty of upside still to come. Apple reported mixed results in the third quarter Apple delivered better-than-expected financial results for the fiscal third quarter (ended July 1), but its performance was far from extraordinary. Total revenue decreased 1.4% year over year to $81.8 billion, the third consecutive year-over-year decline in quarterly revenue, as weakness in the iPhone, Mac, and iPad segments more than offset strength in the services segment. On the bright side, Apple continued to become more profitable. While revenue declined, gross profit increased 1.5% year over year to $36.4 billion as high-margin services accounted for a large chunk of total sales. That margin expansion trickled down to the bottom line, where GAAP net income climbed 2.3% to $19.9 billion. But earnings actually jumped 5% to $1.26 per diluted share as the company continued to buy back stock. Image source: The Motley Fool. Looking ahead, management expects sales in the iPhone and services segments to accelerate in the fiscal fourth quarter. Apple has a durable competitive advantage Warren Buffett sees a sustainable competitive advantage as the most important quality any business can possess. Competitive advantages come in different shapes and sizes, but they generally boil down to pricing power. A business that can raise prices without losing market share to the competition is a good business, according to Buffett, and he believes Apple has pricing power in spades. Buffett made his point in a CNBC interview earlier this year: \"If you&#039;re an Apple user and somebody offers you $10,000, but the only proviso is they&#039;ll take away your iPhone and you&#039;ll never be able to buy another, you&#039;re not going to take it,\" he said. Very few companies inspire that type of consumer loyalty or possess that kind of pricing power, but Apple is no ordinary company. The investment thesis for Apple The Apple brand is synonymous with premium devices, and the company enjoys a strong market presence in several consumer electronics verticals, including a leadership position in smartwatches and tablets. But the iPhone is the real breadwinner. Apple is the second-largest smartphone manufacturer in the world, and its market share has climbed 700 basis points to 17% over the last four years, while Samsung has only managed to tread water at 22%. That puts Apple in a good spot. The global smartphone market is expected to increase at 6.8% annually through 2030. However, the company has more exciting growth opportunities on the services side of its business, where Apple monetizes its installed base of 2 billion active devices with higher-margin products like cloud storage, mobile app store content, streaming media, and financial services. Apple has a particularly strong foothold in two of those markets. The Apple App Store earns twice as much revenue as its closest competitor, and Apple Pay is nearly three times as popular among U.S. consumers as the next closest in-store mobile wallet. That puts the company in a good position. The global mobile app market is expected to grow at 13.8% annually through 2030, and the U.S. mobile wallet market is expected to grow at 26.7% annually over the same period. Is Apple stock worth buying? Given the industry forecasts, investors can reasonably expect Apple to grow hardware revenue and services revenue in the mid-single digits and low double-digits, respectively, through the end of the decade. That gives Apple a good shot at growing total revenue between 6% and 9% annually over the same period. However, its bottom line should grow more quickly because services revenue earns higher margins and the company consistently repurchases shares. Accounting for that, Apple has a good shot at growing earnings per share between 10% and 15% annually through 2030. With that in mind, Apple stock currently trades at 32 times earnings, a premium to its three-year average of 24.7 times earnings. I question whether Apple can deliver market-beating returns over the next five to 10 years starting from that valuation, but Buffett evidently thinks otherwise.

Your Watch Will Likely Get A Radical Software Overhaul\n内容: Apple, Inc. AAPL Watch is likely to get one of the biggest software updates, since the launch of its original version in 2015.What Happened: With WatchOS 10, the next iteration of the Apple Watch operating system, the company plans to bring back widgets, which were part of the earliest versions of the watch but discontinued after just a few years, wrote Bloomberg columnist Mark Gurman on Sunday.Cupertino now wants widgets as a central part of the interface, Gurman wrote.The updated software will be unveiled at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June, the columnist added.Why Is The Widget Back? The new widgets system will be a combination of the old watchOS Glances system and the style of the widgets that were introduced in iOS 14 on the iPhone, Gurman wrote.\"The plan is to let users scroll through a series of different widgets — for activity tracking, weather, stock tickers, calendar appointments and more — rather than having them launch apps,\" the columnist explained. The new interface, according to Gurman, will be similar to the Siri watch face that was introduced in WatchOS 4 but will be available as an overlay for any watch face.Apple is also testing altering functions of some of the watch buttons as part of the overhaul, Gurman wrote, noting that the watch’s Digital Crown will likely be used to open up widgets instead of launching the home screen.See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Apple StockRevving Up Apps: Gurman noted that, even after seven years of the first watch’s launch, Apple Watch apps have barely caught on. The company also hasn&#039;t gotten enough third-party developers on board, he added.With WatchOS 10, Apple will look to give users what they want, with even quicker access to bits of information, Gurman wrote. The company might make the interface optional, at least to start with, he noted. This is because the newest software may be jarring for some longtime Apple Watch users, he explainedGurman wrote that the software update is likely to be the most significant change to the Apple Watch this year since major hardware changes were implemented in 2022. The columnist also expects the new WatchOS 10 to take advantage of the Apple Watch Ultra’s larger, flatter display.\"The current crop of apps and watch faces don&#039;t feel like they were optimized for the Ultra&#039;s additional real estate,\" he wrote.Apple closed Friday&#039;s session up 0.75% at $169.68, according to Benzinga Pro data.Check out more of Benzinga’s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.Read Next: Photo: Shutterstock\n\n---\n\n[2023-05-01] 2023-04-30 20:49:35\n标题: AI faces a long road ahead in healthcare — 'It lacks structure' AI in health care still lacks enough data\n内容: The debate about the use of artificial intelligence and platforms like ChatGPT across sectors is heating up as enthusiasts tout recent breakthroughs, while critics point out AI&#039;s potential pitfalls and ways the technology could be misused. And while AI is already being deployed in some areas of the healthcare sector, there are major hurdles facing the industry as it seeks to bring the latest technological advances into the field. Geeta Nayyar, former chief medical officer at Salesforce, likened these challenges to those facing self-driving cars — not everyone is raising their hand to get into a car driven entirely by AI. \"Now, the idea of a self-driving car that is a complement to someone actually sitting in the driver&#039;s seat, that becomes interesting. That&#039;s what we need in health care,\" Nayyar told Yahoo Finance in an interview. \"Everyone is fixated on this, &#039;We won&#039;t need the doctor anymore...AI is here to save the day.&#039; That&#039;s not so true,\" she added. The topic was a focal point at a major healthcare conference this month, where executives cautioned that there is still more to understand about machine learning and its impact on the sector. One of the biggest uptake problems facing the healthcare sector is one unique to the industry — most healthcare data is largely protected and hidden. And this privacy complicates efforts to build a data pool robust enough to deploy across the sector. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration The US government has already lodged its concerns about AI&#039;s role in healthcare and determined data quality was a key area that needed improvement. \"Developing or expanding access to high-quality datasets could help facilitate training and testing ML (machine learning) technologies across diverse and representative conditions,\" according to the report from the Government Accountability Office. \"This could improve the technologies&#039; performance and generalizability, help developers understand their performance and areas for improvement, and help to build trust and adoption in these technologies.\" Story continues Currently, more than 97% of health data being put into systems does not get used — and the volume of that data has grown in just ten years from 15% of all health information being digital to almost 98% today, GE Healthcare (GE) chief medical officer Taha Kass-Hout told Yahoo Finance. But this data isn&#039;t yet reliable, in Kass-Hout&#039;s view, because it lacks structure.\"[A]nd without that you can&#039;t query and analyze it efficiently or make any decisions,\" Kass-Hout said. &#039;Much more efficient&#039; tools Kass-Hout is still optimistic about the use of AI in health, noting that it is already being used in radiology, for example, as well as with creating new therapies. But he said that still having a human involved in these processes is key to AI&#039;s success. Nayyar agreed, saying AI could also be used as a tool to help patients stick to their medications. She explained, drawing again on the self-driving car example. \"It doesn&#039;t necessarily have to drive the car for you, but can it get you in the right car and tell you to wear your seatbelt,\" Nayyar said. \"There are many different things that AI can do to help complement that patient journey,\" AI also has potential to help the drug industry be more efficient in its research and development. Moderna (MRNA), for example, used AWS (AMZN) to help identify which vaccine formula to pursue in its efforts to protect against COVID-19. \"Moderna was able to reach (development) milestones so quickly due to the programmable nature of mRNA,\" said Dave Johnson, vice president of informatics, data, science and AI at Moderna. And the biotech giant just announced a new partnership with IBM (IBM) to further explore the use of AI in medicine. A vial of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is displayed on a counter at a pharmacy in Portland, Ore., on, Dec. 27, 2021. (AP Photo/Jenny Kane, File) Bill Gates also recently touted AI&#039;s capacity not only to help drug companies, but the potential this technology holds for public health in developing countries. \"There is already software that can look at this data, infer what the pathways are, search for targets on pathogens, and design drugs accordingly.\" the Microsoft (MSFT) founder said in a recent letter. Gates said the next generation of AI tools would be much more efficient, \"and they’ll be able to predict side effects and figure out dosing levels.\" Some experts are hoping AI can help with paperwork as well, a significant burden for clinicians in the era of electronic medical records and claims, as well as on the insurer side in deciding about coverage of claims. Bad data can &#039;jeopardize progress&#039; Experts are also concerned about AI&#039;s potential to produce results based on skewed data the machines learn from, a known risk with machine learning models in healthcare. Addressing these problems would also help ease concerns of clinicians, the GAO&#039;s report noted. And a familiar pathway — robust clinical trials — could be a solution. \"While there is excitement and demonstrated benefits to bringing (AI) tools into clinical practice, poor data quality and prevalent biases in health care can jeopardize progress towards achieving health equity and fuel ongoing uncertainties and hesitancies about adopting these tools,\" the report stated. That&#039;s partly why the recent debate has focused on moving ahead too quickly with the technology, as highlighted in a recent letter signed by Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, among others. It doesn&#039;t call for a pause on AI development in general, but \"merely a stepping back from the dangerous race to ever-larger unpredictable black-box models with emergent capabilities\" for at least six months. \"If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium,\" the letter stated. The logo of OpenAI is displayed near a response by its AI chatbot ChatGPT on its website, in this illustration picture taken February 9, 2023. REUTERS/Florence Lo/Illustration But some, like Gates, have said calling for a pause is unrealistic. Instead, there should be responsible building, Kass-Hout said. Which is easier in the health world, thanks to the amount of regulation already in place. That makes it more likely that responsible use of AI will be top of mind, which means knowing how the models are behaving over time, how to measure outcomes, and ensuring that \"there is a human in the loop that&#039;s evaluating, correcting, editing,\" Kass-Hout added. And the data have to get to a point of being robust, or multi-modal. That includes storing a person&#039;s medical notes, texts, medical images, records, and lab results all in one place to help with analysis and diagnosis. All of which, in Kass-Hout&#039;s view, means it will take time for this technology to have a large impact on the health care sector. \"These models have never been trained on these kinds of data.\" Follow Anjalee on\n\n---\n\n[2023-05-01] 2023-05-01 05:07:39\n标题: App Store Showdown: Elon Musk & Spotify CEO Call Out Apple's Stranglehold On Twitter Subscriptions\n内容: Elon Musk and Spotify Technology S.A. SNAP founder and CEO Daniel Ek once again slammed Apple Inc.’s AAPL App Store guidelines, referring to them as “absurd” and presenting a “serious scaling” problem. What Happened: After introducing the Twitter “Subscriptions” feature earlier this month, Musk responded to inquiries from users explaining why subscriptions take longer to appear on iPhones than on the web. According to Musk, the reason behind this delay is Apple because all “subscriptions currently have to be approved” by the tech giant. See Also: YouTube Music Takes On Spotify In The Battle For Podcast SupremacySpotify CEO then quote-tweeted Musk’s post, criticized Apple’s guidelines and called them “absurd,” to which the Twitter CEO responded, saying, “This is becoming a serious scaling challenge.” Musk and Ek are referring to App Store guidelines regarding in-app subscriptions for digital content, which Twitter must comply with as these new subscriptions are accessible through the iPhone app, reported 9To5Mac. Why It’s Important: This isn’t the first time Musk and Ek have come together to criticize Apple’s App Store guidelines. In October last year, Ek accused Apple of continuing to “disadvantage competitors.” Musk responded to his remarks, saying it is a “concerning” issue. There has been a longstanding conflict between Spotify and Apple concerning the 30% commission that the Cupertino, California-based tech giant levies on apps to sell their products and services on the App Store, as well as the regulations it imposes on such apps.According to Apple, its payment system safeguards users against fraudulent activities, thereby ensuring the App Store is a secure platform for use.Check out more of Benzinga’s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.Read Next:\n\n---\n\n[2023-05-01] 2023-05-01 09:54:00\n标题: If I Could Buy Only 1 Warren Buffett Stock in May, This Would Be It\n内容: When it comes to investing ideas, I can&#039;t think of a better fount of wisdom than Warren Buffett.

Analyst Dan Ives, who has an outperform rating on Apple (AAPL), said recent supply chain checks out of Asia showed solid results for the iPhone, despite worries about the global economy. Additionally, the company is likely to benefit from \"stable\" Services revenue and at least meet Wall Street estimates. \"We believe iPhone units based on a clear uptick in demand around the key China region this quarter could show some upside despite the shaky macro as higher ASPs and overall upgrade activity on iPhone Pro 14 carry the day for [Tim Cook and company],\" Ives wrote in an investor note. A consensus of analysts estimate Apple (AAPL) will earn $1.43 per share and report $92.84B in revenue. Ives added Apple (AAPL) has gained roughly 3% market share in China over the past 12 months. Going forward, the transition from the iPhone 14 line to the next iPhone lineup should be a \"steadier transition\" than in the past, as Ives said the next iteration is likely to be \"highly anticipated,\" even as the average selling price continues to near $900 per iPhone, due to strength for its premium Pro and Pro Max devices. The analyst also posited Apple (AAPL) is likely to see easier year-over-year comparisons as foreign exchange headwinds have slowed down into fiscal 2024. Conversely, Seeking Alpha contributor Bluesea Research forecasts negative growth for Apple&#039;s (AAPL) services unit, which is likely to hurt the stock in the near-term. Separately, Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan said Apple (AAPL) is likely to update its capital return program when it reports quarterly results, adding a new $80B buyback and a 5% dividend increase.

Most important is the Fed interest rate decision on Wednesday afternoon at 2 p.m. ET. A 0.25% hike is near certain, with Fed Funds futures indicating an 87% likelihood -- but it is the policy statement that will be the primary focus. The big question will be whether or not the Fed indicates it is ready to halt rate hikes and wait to see if the lag effect of its policy is working. The market currently sees a 28% chance of another quarter-point hike on June 14. Just one month ago, the odds were zero, however, there are some signs that inflation is holding up in various areas and that the Fed is still concerned. Despite the uncertainty about what the Fed will do, the market has been optimistic about the economy. Good reports from Microsoft (MSFT) , Meta (META) , Alphabet (GOOGL) , and others have helped to push the senior indexes higher and created positive sentiment. Nevertheless, the bears have been focused on the narrowness of the market. A relatively small number of big-cap names have been driving the action, and these stocks may not be reflective of the issues that are facing the overall economy. Microsoft, for example, is benefiting from the boom in Artificial Intelligence, and that has little to do with current economic conditions. This week there will be hundreds more earnings reports to digest, but the \"Big Kahuna,\" Apple (AAPL) , will be the star of the show. Apple reports on Thursday night and is likely to be more impacted by the economy than some of the other large-cap technology names that have reported. There is an intense battle taking place between the economic bears convinced that the lag effect of Fed rate hikes will hit hard and the price-action bulls focused on the narrow strength in the indexes and confident that the economy is strong enough to avoid a painful recession. What is most important this week isn&#039;t the actual news but the market reaction to that news. The market has been fighting the hawkish Fed for a while, and that will come into focus with the policy meeting this week. There have been some good responses to earnings, and that has likely increased the hope of a positive reaction to Apple. I am starting the week with high levels of cash and little interest in doing any major buying right now. Most of the smaller stocks I favor are not exhibiting relative strength or good technical setups, and I&#039;m going to stay patient until that changes. Hopefully, the news this week will shake things up. (MSFT, GOOGL and AAPL are holdings in the Action Alerts PLUS member club.

You tell the officers involved ‘I have an AirTag,’ and they will immediately, with citywide apprehension apparatus, start putting that tag citywide,” said NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell. According to the NYPD, videos on TikTok providing instructions to thieves have contributed to an uptick in the theft of Kias and Hyundais, the report noted. Why It’s Important: Initially intended to aid in locating lost items such as wallets or luggage, the AirTag has been utilized for purposes beyond its original design. This includes an instance where an army wife used the device to locate a wayward mover and a car owner tracked down their stolen vehicle using the AirTag.It is pertinent to note that AirTags have also been widely used for harassment and stalking purposes. Apple previously acknowledged such concerns and informed users about new software updates that address such issues, including tracking people without consent.Check out more of Benzinga’s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.Read Next:\n\n---\n\n[2023-05-01] 2023-05-01 12:00:07\n标题: Apple: B of A Securities maintains a 'Neutral' Rating, The Target Price is $173\n内容: B of A Securities maintains 'Neutral' rating on Apple(AAPL).The target price is $173, compare with $168 previously.

The Cupertino-based company is rarely the first to bring a product to market, but with the help of top-paid talent, Apple just does it better than everyone else. Setting The Stage: It all started with Steve Jobs. The Apple co-founder didn&#039;t just unveil new products, he would sell the world on Apple&#039;s version before anyone even knew what he was offering.Jobs could shape a product presentation into a story that kept audiences anxiously awaiting the next chapter. He would meticulously craft the unveiling, the same way Apple carefully crafts its products. Apple carries that on today. The company doesn&#039;t need to have its hand in every cookie jar, instead, it focuses on being the best in the areas it decides to touch, and it hires some of the best talent to help make its vision a reality.

The jury in federal court in Santa Ana could not determine whether Cupertino, California-based Apple misused confidential information from Masimo related to the use of light to measure biomarkers including heart rates and blood-oxygen levels, U.S. District Judge James Selna said. The jury began deliberating on April 26 after a trial lasting about three weeks. Apple said in a statement that it \"deeply respects intellectual property and innovation and does not take or use confidential information from other companies,\" and will ask the court to dismiss remaining claims in the case. A Masimo spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Irvine, California-based Masimo and its spinoff Cercacor Laboratories Inc sued Apple in 2020, accusing it of stealing trade secrets and using them to create and sell several Apple Watch models. The lawsuit claimed Masimo representatives met with Apple in 2013 about integrating its inventions into Apple products and that Apple subsequently hired away two executives - one from Masimo and one from Cercacor - and used their knowledge to copy the technology. Masimo asked for more than $1.8 billion in damages, reduced from its initial request for $3.1 billion after the judge dismissed some of its trade-secret claims during trial. Apple in a court filing called Masimo&#039;s lawsuit a \"maneuver to clear a path\" for its own smartwatch. Apple sued Masimo in Delaware last year, accusing it of patent infringement. Smartwatches, mobile devices worn on the wrist with an array of capabilities, are a lucrative market, with global sales worth tens of billions of dollars. Masimo has also sued Apple at the U.S. International Trade Commission over Apple Watch imports that it said violated its patent rights. An ITC judge preliminarily ruled in favor of Masimo in January, which could lead to an import ban on infringing Apple Watches if the full commission affirms the decision. Apple is facing another potential Apple Watch import ban in a separate patent fight with Mountain View, California-based medical device maker AliveCor Inc over heart-monitoring technology.

U.S. District Judge James Selna declared a mistrial late Monday after a jury failed to reached a unanimous decision. The jury told the judge that six of the seven jury members planned to vote in favor of Apple (AAPL) at the Santa Ana, California federal court, according to court observers. Masimo (MASI) alleged in its suit against Apple (AAPL) that the iPhone maker improperly used trade secrets for a blood-oxygen monitoring sensor used in its Apple Watch. The trial started on April 4. Masimo (MASI) and a co-plaintiff had sought damages of $3.1 billion from Apple (AAPL) related to the trade secret claims, though a federal judge last Wednesday ruled the maximum Apple would be liable for $1.85 billion, according to media reports, including Bloomberg. Masimo told Bloomberg in a statement that it planned to retry the case. “While we are disappointed that the jury was unable to reach a verdict, we intend to retry the case and continue to pursue legal redress against Apple,” Masimo said in the statement. Apple (AAPL) also commented after the judge declared the mistrial. “We deeply respect intellectual property and innovation and do not take or use confidential information from other companies,” Apple (AAPL) said in a statement to Bloomberg. “We are pleased that the court correctly rejected half of the plaintiffs’ trade secret allegations, and will now ask the court to dismiss the remaining claims.” More on Masimo\n\n---\n\n[2023-05-02] 2023-05-02 04:15:37\n标题: Hollywood writers strike for first time since 2007, with streaming in focus (NASDAQ:NFLX)\n内容: Charley Gallay/Getty Images News Hollywood writers voted Monday night to go on strike just after midnight Pacific Time -- the first such labor stoppage in the entertainment industry since the strike of 2007, and one that once again threatened to slow program production that had recovered from deep COVID-19 pandemic stoppages. The Writers Guild of America West and Writers Guild of America East voted unanimously to authorize the strike and begin picketing Tuesday afternoon. \"The decision was made following six weeks of negotiating with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Disney (NYSE:DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), NBCUniversal (CMCSA), Paramount+ (PARA) (PARAA) and Sony (SONY) under the umbrella of the [Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers],\" the WGA West said. \"The companies’ behavior has created a gig economy inside a union workforce, and their immovable stance in this negotiation has betrayed a commitment to further devaluing the profession of writing,\" the Guild added. Guild members will be prohibited from working on struck productions, and will be unable to sell or pitch scripts. While network shows will see their pipelines start to empty, immediate effects will be felt on late-night talk shows, Deadline noted, with all set to go dark and replace their new programming with reruns starting Tuesday. The 2007 strike, 100 days long, cost billions of dollars in lost output, and wiped out a quarter of prime-time programming for the network TV season. In the years since, much has changed about how people view television. For one thing, streaming was brand new back then, and now it&#039;s at the center of negotiations, with writers seeking more inclusion in residuals and back-end payments. Also notable in the new negotiations is (of course) AI, and how the union will be able to protect jobs amid the new technological tools. The union is also looking to curb the practice (fed heavily by the new streaming providers) of creating \"mini-rooms,\" smaller groups of writers producing scripts in advance of the production of a series.\n\n---\n\n[2023-05-02] 2023-05-02 09:03:31\n标题: Apple Vs Microsoft: Safari Overtakes Edge In Browser Battle, But An Old Rival Still Dominates\n内容: Apple Inc.’s AAPL Safari overtook Microsoft Corp’s MSFT Edge in the fight for the top desktop browser, but a third player seems to be unquestionably winning the war.

Microsoft’s decision to take this step came in the backdrop of Google and Chrome’s dominance in search and browser segments, respectively.

AAPL is scheduled to report its fiscal year second-quarter results Thursday after the close. The report assumes importance because investors hinge their hope on solid earnings from the company to reignite the market momentum.Pointers Positive: Apple should report at least in-line iPhone revenue, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note, citing the firm&#039;s Asia supply chain checks. The analyst sees some upside in iPhone shipments, premised on a clear uptick in demand around the key China region during the March quarter.Higher average selling prices, or ASPs, and overall upgrade activity on the iPhone Pro 14 could help offset shaky macro fundamentals, the analyst said. The analyst estimates that ASPs were bumping up toward $900/$925 on iPhones, adding that it is a \"noteworthy trend heading into the next iPhone cycle.\"The uptick in App Store should keep services revenue stable, Ives said.Both combined should translate into headline numbers that should at least meet Wall Street expectations, Wedbush said.The firm expects the services business to reaccelerate to a double-digit trajectory over the coming quarters. It based the optimism on another 100 million+ new iPhone users added to the Apple ecosystem over the past 16 months, improving attach rates on services and price increases. Overall the service business is worth $1.2 trillion to $1.3 trillion, the firm added.See Also: Best Technology Stocks Right NowChina Momentum Intact: Apple has gained about 300 basis points of market share in China over the past 12 months, the analyst said.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL, FedEx FDX, Marathon Petroleum MPC and Stellantis STLA. Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog: Is This the &#039;Terminal&#039; Fed Hike? Global Week Ahead In the Global Week Ahead, regular monetary policy meetings held by: The U.S. Fed The European Central Bank (ECB), and Australia&#039;s central bank (the RBA) top the agenda The mega-cap tech company Apple Inc. brings the U.S. Q1 earnings season mostly to an end. All of this happens as financial markets work through fresh regional banking tremors, brought on by First Republic Bank in San Francisco, CA. Next are Reuters’ five world market themes, reordered for equity traders— (1) On Wednesday, One More 25bps Policy Rate Hike from the FOMC? The Fed is expected to deliver another 25-basis point interest rate increase on Wednesday and signal a pause in its most aggressive rate-hiking cycle since the 1980s. Policymakers and markets remain at odds over the rates trajectory: The world&#039;s top central bank projects borrowing costs to remain at around current levels through 2023, investors are betting on cuts after the summer. Signs the Fed may be coming around to the market’s view could push Treasury yields lower - in theory benefiting the big mega-cap stocks that led markets higher this year. Futures markets show investors pricing a nearly 90% chance of a rate increase. But confidence in a 25-basis point rate hike has wavered in recent days after problems at lender First Republic (FRC) reignited concerns over the U.S. banking sector. (2) On Thursday, Mega-cap Apple Reports Q1 Earnings The U.S. corporate earnings season reaches a crescendo on Thursday with results from Apple, the largest U.S. company by market value, at $2.6 trillion. Along with other mega-cap stocks, Apple has led the S&amp;P 500&#039;s rally in 2023, giving the company even more heft in indexes. Apple&#039;s over-7% weight in the S&amp;P500 is bigger than the entire energy sector and nearly matches the consumer staples group. The iPhone maker is expected to post $93 billion in revenue for its fiscal second quarter - a 4.4% drop year-on-year, Refinitiv data shows. Analysts expect a nearly -6% drop in earnings per share to $1.43. The report from Apple, whose widely used products and services include MacBooks and iPads but also banking, is a gauge for global consumer demand, and its results stand to ripple through markets given its importance to a number of industries. (3) On Thursday, European Central Bank (ECB) Follows FOMC with Policy Rate Hike The ECB will likely lift rates for a seventh straight time on May 4th and policymakers appear to be converging on a 25-basis point hike rather than a larger 50-bp increase. Yet key inflation and bank lending data releases in the days ahead could sway that outcome. With some stability returning to the banking sector after the March rout, hawks may feel confident pushing for a large hike. Tuesday&#039;s flash April inflation data is likely to confirm underlying price pressures — running above 5% — remains uncomfortably high. Some 2.5 million employees in Germany&#039;s public sector will get a 5.5% permanent increase next year, a sign that wage pressures are picking up. But if bank lending data, also out Tuesday, shows credit conditions have tightened substantially, doves could feel emboldened to push back. (4) On Tuesday, Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Offers Policy Settings Bets for a return to policy tightening by the Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday have fizzled out, after a soft reading of consumer prices added to evidence that inflation peaked at the end of last year. That has put the Aussie dollar under pressure, keeping it pinned near the closely watched $0.66-mark, even when the greenback wilted against other major peers. RBA governor Philip Lowe has stressed a pause at the April meeting did not necessarily mean the tightening cycle is over, and minutes showed a hike was hotly debated. Whether Lowe, whose term ends in September, will be around to oversee further moves is another question. Speculation is rife that, unlike his two predecessors, he won&#039;t be asked to stay on. (5) U.K. Macro Data Updates on Struggling Economy The U.K.&#039;s 1970s-style inflation and near-zero growth isn&#039;t a good look. There isn&#039;t a credit crunch — yet — according to a recent Bank of England survey. But lenders expect rising defaults on consumer credit, mortgages and corporate loans. Data on Tuesday will show whether house prices are indeed moderating, and if the decline in mortgage lending is stabilizing. New car sales, which in March hit 18-month highs, will also be under scrutiny. Brits loaded up on credit card debt at the fastest pace in a 24-month period since early 2006 in February and data from the BoE on Thursday will show how that trend is evolving. This kind of borrowing isn&#039;t cheap. BoE stats show the average interest rate on a UK credit card is 22.5% — its highest since the mid-1990&#039;s. And with more rate rises in the pipeline, the pressure is only likely to intensify. Meanwhile Prime Minister Rishi Sunak faces his first big electoral test on May 4 in local polls where the opposition Labor Party hopes to capitalize on a year of chaos for the governing Conservatives.

The iPhone maker is one of the most profitable businesses in history, with a staggering $100 billion in net income in fiscal 2022 alone. Here are two reasons even more profits likely are ahead for Apple and its shareowners -- as well as a key risk that investors need to be mindful of. 1. Apple&#039;s ecosystem is becoming stickier Once people buy an Apple device, they tend to remain loyal customers. This strong user retention is a major reason for the company&#039;s success. It generates bountiful recurring revenue, both from repeat device sales and ongoing service subscriptions. To make its offerings even more sticky, Apple is making a major push into financial services. The technology titan recently unveiled a new high-yield savings account it will offer in partnership with investment bank Goldman Sachs. With a compelling 4.15% annual yield, no minimum deposit or balance requirements, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation coverage, Apple&#039;s new savings accounts are likely to enjoy high demand from consumers. An Apple Card is necessary to open an account. Interest in the savings accounts should thus bolster the adoption of Apple&#039;s credit card and payment processing service, Apple Pay. Users can also easily deposit the cash rewards they earn from using the Apple Card into these savings accounts. Together, this burgeoning suite of financial products should help to lock Apple&#039;s customers into its product and service ecosystem. 2. A massive new growth market awaits Apple produced $394 billion in revenue in 2022, but it still has plenty of room for expansion. Much of this growth is set to occur in international markets, particularly India. With more than 1.4 billion people, India is now the world&#039;s most populous nation, according to the United Nations. And many of these people are planning to purchase their first Apple device. Apple already generates nearly $6 billion in annual revenue in India, according to Bloomberg. That&#039;s up roughly 50% from the prior year. To help drive those sales even higher, Apple opened its first retail store in the country earlier this month, and it plans to open many more. The company currently has a relatively small share of India&#039;s smartphone market, which is dominated by lower-priced devices. But the growing middle class is showing a propensity to pay up for higher-quality goods. Phones priced above $400 now account for 10% of India&#039;s total phone sales, up from 4% prior to the pandemic, according to Counterpoint Research. All told, Wedbush Securities estimates that Apple&#039;s annual sales in India could climb to $20 billion by 2025. This risk should not be overlooked Still, an investment in Apple is not without risk. Perhaps the biggest threat to the company&#039;s highly lucrative business model is its reliance on China for its manufacturing. That country&#039;s strict COVID-19 lockdowns created supply chain disruptions for Apple, and highlighted the risks posed by the tech company&#039;s concentrated production network. China&#039;s increasingly aggressive stance toward Taiwan and the potential for conflict in the region create an even more worrisome scenario. To mitigate these risks, Apple is working to diversify its supply chain. Yet the challenge isn&#039;t to just shift production to other countries but to do it in a way that preserves Apple&#039;s sky-high profit margins. Fortunately, India has emerged as a possible solution. Apple currently manufactures about 7% of its iPhones in India, and it plans to increase that figure to 25% in the coming years, according to Piyush Goyal, India&#039;s minister of commerce and industry. Other officials would also like to see that happen. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is spearheading an incentive program to boost production in India, which could make it easier for Apple&#039;s manufacturing partners to expand in this fast-growing country. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But it&#039;s more attainable than you might think. You don&#039;t need to know a lot about investing to build wealth in the market, but you will need the right investments. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a smart option for many people, as they require much less maintenance than individual stocks yet can still see substantial returns. While there are many different ETFs to choose from, there are two funds that could potentially turn $100 per week into nearly $800,000 -- with very little effort on your part. 1. Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) tracks the S&amp;P 500, which means it includes the same stocks as the index itself and aims to mirror its performance over time. The S&amp;P 500 includes stocks from 500 of the largest and most stable companies in the U.S., and by investing in this ETF, you&#039;d own a stake in all of those stocks. The primary advantage of this ETF is that it&#039;s an incredibly safe long-term investment. The S&amp;P 500 itself has not only survived many recessions, bear markets, and crashes over the decades, but it&#039;s also earned positive average returns. If you invest in this ETF, your investment will likely take a hit during periods of volatility. But it&#039;s almost guaranteed to recover and go on to see positive returns over time. For those looking for a safe and reliable ETF, you can&#039;t go wrong with this one. Historically, the S&amp;P 500 itself has earned an average annual return of around 10% per year. Because this fund tracks the index, it&#039;s likely it will earn similar returns over the long run. If you were investing $100 per week while earning a 10% average annual return, here&#039;s approximately how much you could accumulate over time: Number of Years Total Savings 20 $275,000 25 $472,000 30 $790,000 35 $1,301,000 40 $2,124,000 Data source: Author&#039;s calculations via Investor.gov. Reaching $790,000 in total savings will take approximately 30 years at this rate, but the more time you give your money to grow, the more you&#039;ll earn. With an extra decade, you could build a portfolio worth well over $2 million. One other advantage of this ETF is that it offers a rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.03%. This is one of the lowest among its competitors, which could save you thousands of dollars in fees over time. 2. Vanguard Growth ETF The Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: VUG) is an investment designed to earn above-average returns. It includes 240 stocks from a variety of industries, though about half of the fund is comprised of stocks in the tech sector. Growth ETFs tend to carry more risk than S&amp;P 500 ETFs, as high-growth companies are often more volatile than their more established counterparts. The tech industry, in particular, is generally hit hard during periods of volatility, so this ETF may see more significant short-term downturns than the previous fund. That said, this ETF is a strong choice because it balances risk and reward. The top 10 holdings make up roughly half of this fund, and these stocks are behemoth corporations such as Amazon, Apple, Visa, and Home Depot. The rest of the fund, then, is comprised of up-and-coming stocks with the potential for explosive returns. This approach can limit your risk with the \"safe\" stocks, while still giving you plenty of room for growth. Since its inception in 2004, this fund has earned an average rate of return of just under 10% per year. While that may seem low, keep in mind that the tech sector is still struggling amid this downturn, so it&#039;s normal to see lower returns in times like these. Over the past 10 years, this ETF has earned an average return of around 13.6% per year. Even slightly higher-than-average returns can still go a long way. If, for example, you were to invest $100 per week while earning a 12% average annual return, here&#039;s roughly how much you&#039;d have over time: Number of Years Total Savings 20 $346,000 25 $640,000 30 $1,158,000 35 $2,072,000 40 $3,682,000 Source: Author&#039;s calculations via Investor.gov. There are never any promises when investing, so it&#039;s unclear exactly what types of returns this fund will earn over decades. This fund is also higher-risk, so be prepared for greater volatility. But because it&#039;s designed to earn higher-than-average returns, there&#039;s a better chance you&#039;ll beat the market with this ETF. Regardless of where you invest, time is your most valuable resource. The sooner you get started, the easier it will be to generate hundreds of thousands of dollars or more in the stock market. 10 stocks we like better than Vanguard Index Funds-Vanguard Growth ETF When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The tech giant is facing a lawsuit worth up to 1.6 billion pounds plus interest, brought by consumer champion Justin Gutmann on behalf of iPhone users in the United Kingdom. Gutmann&#039;s lawyers argued in court filings that Apple concealed issues with batteries in certain phone models and \"surreptitiously\" installed a power management tool which limited performance. Apple said in written arguments that the lawsuit is \"baseless\" and strongly denies its iPhones&#039; batteries were defective, apart from in a small number of iPhone 6s models for which it offered free battery replacements. The company also says its power management update – introduced in 2017 to manage demands on older batteries or with a low level of charge – only reduced an iPhone 6&#039;s performance by an average of 10%. Gutmann on Tuesday asked London&#039;s Competition Appeal Tribunal to certify the case and allow it to proceed towards a trial. His lawyer Philip Moser referred to Apple&#039;s 2020 agreements to settle a U.S. class action and regulatory action by U.S. states over iPhone battery issues as showing Apple was not \"saying this never happened\". Apple had also committed to be \"clearer and more upfront\" with iPhone users about battery health to Britain&#039;s competition watchdog in 2019, Moser said. The company denies misleading its customers about iPhone battery issues and points to a public apology it issued in 2017, offering cheaper battery replacements to affected customers. Apple&#039;s lawyer David Wolfson said in court filings that the lawsuit effectively alleges that \"not all batteries could deliver the peak power demanded in all circumstances at all times\", which was common to all battery-powered devices.

Cupertino, California-based Apple (AAPL) had 145 drivers for its program as of April 28, down from 201 in March, according to MacReports, citing California DMV data. The company&#039;s fleet of cars, however, only fell by one, to 66, the news outlet added. Apple (AAPL) did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Seeking Alpha. In 2017, Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook confirmed the existence of the tech giant&#039;s interest in autonomous vehicles, calling it \"the mother of all AI projects.\" Earlier this year, Cook said artificial intelligence &#039;is a major focus\" of the company, adding that the company sees \"enormous potential\" for AI to impact \"virtually everything we do.\" To date, however, Apple (AAPL) has not publicly said it is building an autonomous car, though many media outlets, including Seeking Alpha, have reported on the existence of the tech giant&#039;s initiatives, under an initiative known as Project Titan. Last year, Morgan Stanley analysts pondered whether Apple (AAPL) could compete with Tesla (TSLA) in the space, given the vast head-start the Elon Musk-led company has over Apple. At the time, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said Apple (AAPL) entering the electric vehicle market would be the \"ultimate bear case\" for a number of companies, including GM (GM), Fisker (FSR), Ferrari (RACE) and others. No time frame has been given for such an announcement, though Citi analyst Jim Suva said in December that a 2025 launch of the company&#039;s move into the market, depending upon the route it takes, could boost the company&#039;s overall sales between 2% and 15%.

The two companies behind the iPhone and the software that powers Android phones on Tuesday submitted a proposal to set standards for combatting secret surveillance on Apple&#039;s AirTag trackers and similar gadgets. The concept also has the backing of Samsung, which sells the most Android smartphones worldwide, as well as tracking products similar to the AirTag such as Tile, Chipolo, and Pebblebee. The $30 AirTag has become a popular item since its 2021 release, helping users pinpoint the locations of a wide variety of lost property. But stalkers have also deployed AirTags and similar products to shadow former love interests and other people who don’t realize they are being tracked. “Bluetooth trackers have created tremendous user benefits, but they also bring the potential of unwanted tracking, which requires industrywide action to solve,” said Dave Burke, Google’s vice president of Engineering for Android. Apple and AirTag hope to have a plan in place by the end of this year to thwart stealth tracking. The solution would be distributed through software updates to iPhones and Android phones. Erica Olsen, the senior director of National Network to End Domestic Violence’s Safety Net Project, applauded the effort to set an industry standard that she believes will help protect survivors of abusive relationships and other people that have been targets of stealth technology. “These new standards will minimize opportunities for abuse of this technology and decrease the burden on survivors in detecting unwanted trackers,” Olsen said.\n\n---\n\n[2023-05-03] 2023-05-02 17:34:28\n标题: 10 Best Consumer Electronics Stocks To Buy\n内容: In this article, we discuss 10 best consumer electronics stocks to buy.

The employment situation in the United States remains robust, and the labor market continues to be highly competitive. According to the latest report from the Labor Department, the unemployment rate stands at 3.5%, indicating a significant recovery as more individuals have returned to work following the Covid pandemic. However, retailers like Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE:BBY) have expressed a cautious outlook due to a decline in consumer spending in certain categories like consumer electronics. This shift in consumer behavior has resulted in reduced sales of non-essential items, as individuals prioritize spending on essential goods due to inflationary pressures. The company also laid off hundreds of employees as consumer spending patterns are changing swiftly. Similarly, CNBC reported that Foxconn, a major supplier for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), announced a 10% decrease in profit for 2022 and predicted a decline in consumer electronics demand for the entire year ahead. This downbeat sentiment is in line with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s own cautious expectations for consumer sales. During Apple&#039;s first-quarter 2023 earnings report, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said that they anticipated double-digit declines in Mac and iPad sales for the upcoming March quarter, compared to the previous year. However, the decline in iPhone sales is expected to be less significant in the March quarter compared to the December quarter. Foxconn plans to expand its operations beyond mainland China and has identified exploring new markets as a key priority for the company in 2023. Despite the near-term outlook muted because of a global recession, the consumer electronics market is expected to witness sustained growth in the coming years, primarily driven by advancements in technology and rapidly changing consumer preferences. These factors will fuel innovation and competition within the industry.

(NYSE:VZIO) in its Q1 2022 investor letter: “Reviewing Vizio (NYSE:VZIO), we purchased it quite recently and it has declined precipitously in our brief period of ownership. They have an explicit strategy to sacrifice gross margins from their TVs to further develop the audience for their smart TV offering, a competitor to Roku. I purchased the shares expecting the thesis to play out over a number of years, so I intend to monitor the company and its results as we move forward. Their first quarter results reflected strength in their Platform (Smart TV) segment, which will be their primary source of profit going forward. Further, the news that Netflix and other streaming companies are considering subscriptions that include advertising is positive news. In some ways, what is old is new again, as this development is somewhat of a return to the dual-revenue-stream model cable TV channels use. The shift towards more streaming programming including advertisements is a positive for Vizio, since they may be able to monetize the ads directly or indirectly. I’ll keep you posted on their progress.” 6.

The new proposed industry specification from the two companies \"will allow Bluetooth location-tracking devices to be compatible with unauthorized tracking detection and alerts across iOS and Android platforms,\" Apple and Google said in a press release. It includes \"best practices and instructions\" for companies making location-tracking devices. The companies described the just-announced specification as the \"first-of-its-kind.\" They submitted it to the Internet Engineering Task Force. SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 14, 2022: Discussion of Apple AirTags by Washington Post reporter Geoff Fowler in San Francisco, California Monday March 14, 2022. The capability is important for \"improving the privacy and safety of individuals in the circumstance that those accessories are used to track their location without their knowledge or consent,\" a draft of the proposed industry specification said.

Lettering with the logo of Google is stuck on a glass pane in the press center. Tracker Detect, an app rolled out a couple years ago by Apple that is meant to look out for unwanted tracking, is available for Android users.

We estimate that Apple’s revenue will come in at about $93 billion for the quarter, roughly in line with consensus estimates and about 4% lower compared to last year. We estimate that earnings will stand at close to $1.45 per share, compared to a consensus of $1.43 per share. So what are some of the trends that are likely to drive Apple’s results? See our interactive dashboard analysis on Apple Earnings Preview for more details on how Apple’s revenues and earnings are likely to trend for the quarter. We expect to see slower sales of iPhones, amid economic concerns and weaker consumer spending. However, this could be partially offset by improved availability of the flagship iPhone Pro devices, which remained undersupplied through the holiday quarter. Apple’s other computing devices are also likely to see slower sales. While the iPad could see demand cool versus last year, as the remote working and learning trend seen through the Covid-19 pandemic tapers off. Mac sales are expected to see a more severe slump. For perspective, IDC estimates that Apple’s Mac sales declined by close to 40.5% in Q1 2023. However, this could be offset, in part, by sales of pricier devices such as the Macbook Pros and the all-new Macbook Air. We will be closely watching the performance of Apple’s services business. Services sales have slowed down meaningfully, with revenue growing by just 6.4% in Q1 FY’23 and by about 5% in Q4 FY’22, compared to double-digit levels in the year-ago quarter. This is concerning, given that services are very lucrative, with segment gross margins typically standing at over 70%. The decline is likely being led by the AppStore, with people spending less on gaming and apps as Covid-19 eases. So is Apple stock a buy ahead of earnings? While Apple stock could move slightly higher if it beats earnings, we believe the stock is fundamentally overvalued at current levels of about $170 per share. The stock trades at about 28x forward earnings, which we believe is high, given that Apple’s earnings are poised to contract this year per consensus estimates, with revenue growth projected to remain slow over the next year as well. We value Apple at about $160 per share, about 5% below the market price.

According to the CME FedWatch Tool, traders are factoring-in an 89% probability of a 25 basis points hike. It remains unclear whether the central bank will take a breather from its aggressive monetary policy, Cramer said.Another thing to observe is the upcoming employment numbers from the Labor Department that need to remain steady or witness a drop for the central bank to stop tightening for good, Cramer said.Major Wall Street indices closed over 1% lower on Tuesday as concerns over a banking crisis once again came to the fore and market participants maintained caution ahead of the Fed decision.

The SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust SPY closed 1.12% lower while the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 QQQ lost 0.87% on Tuesday.Debt Ceiling: Cramer expects the looming debt ceiling crisis to be resolved in due course but the markets may witness some hangover over the next couple of weeks.

That a car would drive itself across the country by the end of 2016. Oh, I had to upgrade to that model. You know, $50,000 and then it wouldn&#039;t do anything. I could tell it would never make it across the country.”He added, “And boy, if you want to study AI gone wrong and taking a lot of claims and trying to kill you every chance it can, get a Tesla!” Why It Matters: Wozniak is not the only one who believes Tesla autopilot promises are “not even close to reality” or that it is “trying to kill you.” Shareholders of Tesla sued the automaker and Musk in February alleging that both overstated the effectiveness and safety of the company’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving technologies.Since 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has reportedly opened 40 crash investigations involving Tesla vehicles that may have been driven in Autopilot mode. These crashes also involved 19 deaths. Only last month, the government agency said that it would open an investigation into a crash involving a 2022 Model Y vehicle and a 17-year-old.

I'll Show You 1 Way It Could\n内容: Shiba Inu became the darling of the cryptocurrency industry in 2021 when it generated a gain of 43,800,000%, which could&#039;ve made millionaires out of investors for an outlay of just $3, assuming their timing was perfect. But risk appetite evaporated from the financial markets in 2022, which sent speculative assets like Shiba Inu plunging, and the token remains 89% below its all-time high. Certain realities about its lack of mainstream adoption are also setting in, which is hindering any recovery attempts. But sentiment surrounding the broader crypto industry has improved in 2023, so could Shiba Inu stage another historic run? There might actually be a way the token could soar to $1, but it won&#039;t have the effect most investors think it will. Here are the details. Image source: Getty Images. The crypto industry is coming off its worst year ever Last year was one to forget for cryptocurrency investors. A series of high-profile collapses across the industry reached a crescendo in November when global brokerage firm FTX fell into bankruptcy owing customers an estimated $3 billion. Regulators are still attempting to track down missing funds, and the saga has caused many investors to shun the crypto industry. According to a survey conducted by business news network CNBC at the end of last year, just 8% of Americans have a positive view on cryptocurrencies. That environment is less than ideal for speculative tokens like Shiba Inu, which are seldom used in the real world for transactions. That&#039;s one of the reasons it&#039;s struggling to climb back toward its all-time highs -- just 746 businesses worldwide accept the token as payment for goods and services, which means consumers have little reason to own it. Without adoption, sustaining value over the long term is an uphill battle. The Shiba Inu community is trying to create new use cases for the token, including with a metaverse (virtual world), and a Layer-2 blockchain solution called Shibarium, which is designed to reduce the cost and friction when transacting. But so far, nothing has really moved the needle. Here&#039;s one way Shiba Inu could reach $1 Shiba Inu has a supply issue. There are 589.3 trillion tokens in circulation, which is why its current price of $0.00001 features so many decimal places. The math is simple: If Shiba Inu rose to $1, it would have a total market capitalization of $589.3 trillion, making it the most valuable asset in the world by a wide margin. For a little perspective, Apple is currently the largest company on the planet and it&#039;s worth $2.6 trillion as of this writing. That&#039;s why the Shiba Inu community has been working to reduce that enormous supply figure by burning tokens, which removes them from circulation forever. Investors can participate by sending their tokens to a dead wallet, or by using services that commit a portion of their profits to the cause. They include streaming a certain music playlist and YouTube channel, using the Shiba Search internet search engine, and buying coffee from the Shiba Coffee company. Theoretically, as tokens are burned, Shiba Inu&#039;s price will increase in equal proportion. For Shiba Inu to rise to $1 from here purely through the burn mechanism, the community would have to eliminate 99.9998% of the tokens currently in circulation, bringing the total down from 589.3 trillion to just 6 billion. Here&#039;s the first problem: The community burned just 3.3 billion tokens in the past month. That&#039;s a burn rate of 39.6 billion per year, meaning it would take a whopping 14,881 years to burn supply down to 6 billion. But here&#039;s the second, and much bigger problem. In the end, there would simply be 6 billion tokens in supply trading at $1 per token, placing Shiba Inu&#039;s market capitalization at $6 billion -- exactly where it is today. No investor would see an actual increase in the value of their holdings. Therefore, even if humans found a way to live for thousands of years, it would be an exercise in futility. 10 stocks we like better than Shiba Inu When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Wall Street expects Apple’s top line to drop, reflecting the ongoing weakness in product sales. However, the momentum in Services revenue could continue to support overall sales. Analysts Weigh In Analysts expect Apple to report revenue of $92.91 billion in the second quarter, reflecting a year-over-year decline of about 4.5%. Momentum in Services sales and the easing of supply-chain headwinds and improvement in China could support overall revenue, but tough year-over-year comparisons and pressure on consumer spending due to high inflation and interest rates will likely hurt Mac sales. Monness analyst Brian White expects AAPL’s Q2 revenue to decrease by 6%. In a note to investors dated May 1, White expects iPhone sales to improve compared to Q1. However, he sees iPhone revenue declining by 4% year-over-year. The analyst projects a 43% drop in Mac revenue, reflecting weak consumer spending trends and normalization in demand post the easing of COVID-led lockdowns. Nonetheless, White forecasts a 7% growth in Apple’s Services sales, reflecting a growing installed base of active devices and an increase in paid subscriptions. Along with White, Goldman Sachs analyst Mike Ng sees a 3% drop in Apple’s Q2 revenues. On April 24, the analyst said he expects a 5% fall in AAPL’s product revenues. However, he expects iPhone sales to offset the weakness in Mac revenue. Given the ongoing pressure on its top line, analysts project AAPL’s earnings to decline in Q2. Wall Street expects AAPL to post earnings of $1.43 a share in Q2, compared with an EPS of $1.52 in the prior year’s quarter. Is Apple a Buy, Sell, or Hold? Apple stock has gained about 30% year-to-date. Further, analysts maintain their bullish outlook on AAPL stock. It has received 21 Buy, four Hold, and one Sell recommendations ahead of Q2, reflecting a Strong Buy consensus rating. The analysts’ average price target of $175.05 implies 3.86% upside potential. Bottom Line While Apple’s top line is projected to decline in Q2, iPhone sales could show improvement. Further, the easing of supply-chain headwinds and ongoing strength in the Services segment bodes well for growth. Apple could also provide a favorable update on share buybacks or dividends, which could act as a catalyst.

The results on Thursday from the world&#039;s most valuable company will follow better-than-expected earnings from U.S. technology peers, which had raised hopes that the worst may be over for a sector that has laid off tens of thousands this year. Apple, an industry outlier with no mass layoffs so far, is set to post its first ever revenue declines across product lines, even as iPhone demand and production recovered in China after pandemic-driven disruptions last year. \"Apple is seeing moderate headwinds in its hardware businesses as iPhones face modest contraction in premium device demand and the iPad and Mac businesses could be weighed down by consumer and enterprise trends,\" analysts at Cowen and Co said. Hardware sales are set to decline over 7% to $71.93 billion in the second quarter, according to 23 analysts polled by Visible Alpha. Mac sales, which account for nearly a tenth of Apple&#039;s revenue, likely fell by a quarter, while revenue from flagship iPhone is estimated to have declined by over 3%. Global PC shipments slumped by nearly a third between January and March, according to data from research firm IDC, led by an over 40% drop in those sold by Apple. The global smartphone market, meanwhile, shrank 13% for a fifth straight quarter of decline. CHINA CHEER Apple investors, however, would be encouraged by a recovery in China, the company&#039;s third-largest market. \"The reopening of China, both from the supply chain and the consumer demand standpoint, works in Apple&#039;s favor,\" said Tom Forte of D.A. Davidson, who expects iPhone sales there to rise. A near 1% pullback in the dollar .DXY during the quarter is also a bright spot in what is typically a weak period following the holiday shopping season, analysts said. Revenue in its services business, a key growth engine for Apple and home to its App Store and video streaming service, likely rose about 6%, according to Visible Alpha. That would mark its second lowest growth rate since at least the first quarter of fiscal 2017. \"For Apple, it is much more about a user growth story than a unit growth story,\" said KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brandon Nispel, who believes efforts to grow market share in developing economies such as India and Brazil will be crucial.

Analyst Simon Flannery raised his rating on Globalstar (GSAT) shares to equal-weight from underweight but lowered the price target to $0.97 from $1.75, noting the attention should be elsewhere now that financing needs have been met. \"Moving forward, investors should be focused on the company&#039;s ability to start monetizing its terrestrial spectrum along with progress towards new satellite launches in 2025,\" Flannery wrote in an investor note. Flannery added the company is likely focused on a private 5G network to monetize the spectrum and while the opportunity is slower than some companies, including Verizon (VZ) had liked, the company&#039;s recent deal with Qualcomm (QCOM) to put Band 53 into the chipmaker&#039;s RF ecosystem and sales network is a positive. Following last month&#039;s approval from Spain to provide \"complementary terrestrial service\" for its LTE and 5G networks, the first new approval since November 2020, Flannery said that could \"help pave the way\" for additional approval approvals in Europe for Globalstar (GSAT). Flannery also noted that scaling its satellite internet-of-things business and continued progress of building its satellites are likely to be positive drivers, with the satellites expected to be built and launched by 2025, which should help the company&#039;s deal with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). In 2022, Apple (AAPL) launched Emergency SOS on the iPhone 14 using Globalstar&#039;s (GSAT) satellites and the company is likely to generate at least $80M in revenue from the deal \"over the next several years,\" Flannery added. Late last year, Apple (AAPL) expanded the availability of its Emergency SOS feature to several countries in Western Europe. Analysts are mixed on Globalstar (GSAT). It has a HOLD rating from Seeking Alpha authors, while Wall Street analysts rate it a BUY. Conversely, Seeking Alpha&#039;s quant system, which consistently beats the market, rates GSAT a SELL.

AAPL and Alphabet Inc. GOOG GOOGL have jointly submitted a proposal aimed at combating unwanted tracking via Bluetooth location-tracking devices like AirTag. What Happened: AirTag, which gained popularity following its 2021 release, has proven to be an easy tool for stalkers to track unsuspecting individuals unaware of the monitoring. Now, Apple and Google are collaboratively working towards preventing unsolicited tracking via devices such as AirTags. See Also: Apple Users, Hold Off On iOS 16.3.1 Update — Unless You Want Google Photos To Crash On Your iPhonesThe idea is to develop a new industry standard to counter surveillance using Bluetooth location-tracking devices. The tech giants plan to have a solution by year-end and have submitted a draft to the Internet Engineering Task Force. The update would be distributed via software updates to iOS and Android phones. The joint proposal is supported by Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd SSNLF and companies producing tracking products similar to AirTag, including Tile, Chipolo and Pebblebee. “Bluetooth trackers have created tremendous user benefits, but they also bring the potential of unwanted tracking, which requires industrywide action to solve,” said Dave Burke, Google’s vice president of engineering for Android.“This new industry specification builds upon the AirTag protections, and through collaboration with Google results in a critical step forward to help combat unwanted tracking across iOS and Android,” said Ron Huang, Apple’s vice president of Sensing and Connectivity. Why It’s Important: Following concerns about AirTags being misused, Apple previously announced new updates to its AirTag tracking devices and “Find My Network,” including a feature to alert users if they are being tracked without their consent. Users can take certain precautionary measures before contacting the authorities to avoid being tracked.Check out more of Benzinga’s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.Read Next:\n\n---\n\n[2023-05-03] 2023-05-03 12:22:19\n标题: Apple likely to report 'solid' results, but valuation a concern: Baird (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n内容: yalcinsonat1/iStock via Getty Images Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is slated to report fiscal second-quarter results after the close of trading on Thursday and though the company is likely to report \"solid\" results, its current valuation may be an issue, investment firm Baird said. \"We remain positive on the long-term eco-system benefits, strong free cash flow and capital returns, and are raising our target modestly,\" analyst William Power, who rates Apple (AAPL) outperform, wrote in an investor note. \"However, with valuation vs. the S&amp;P 500 near all-time highs, we&#039;d also be more aggressive buyers on any pullbacks.\" Power noted that Apple (AAPL) is currently trading at 27.8 times 2023 estimated earnings and 26.3 times 2024 estimated earnings, while the S&amp;P 500 is trading at roughly 19 times estimated earnings. This is the highest premium relative to the S&amp;P 500 since 2020. Apple (AAPL) shares have gained around 30% year-to-date, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are up 8.6% and 16.7%, respectively. For the second-quarter, Power expects Apple (AAPL) to generate $1.41 per share in earnings and $92.1B in revenue, including $47.9B from the iPhone. He expects Services revenue to rise 2.1% year-over-year to $20.2B, though the Mac is likely to see some pressure, given IDC&#039;s recent first-quarter data showed Mac shipments fell 40% year-over-year. A consensus of analysts expect Apple (AAPL) to earn $1.43 per share and $92.84B in revenue. In addition, Apple (AAPL) is expected to update its capital return policy, with Power expecting it to \"mirror\" recent years updates, including a higher buyback and \"slightly higher\" dividend.

The segment, which includes revenues from the App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Arcade, Apple TV+, Apple News+ and Apple Card, accounted for 17.7% of sales in first-quarter fiscal 2023. Although Apple’s business primarily runs around its flagship iPhone, the Services portfolio has emerged as the company’s new cash cow. Apple currently has more than 935 million paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. The App Store has been continuing to draw the attention of prominent developers from around the world, helping the company offer appealing apps to drive the App Store traffic, thereby expanding the subscriber base. The company expected Services revenue growth to be negatively impacted by challenging macroeconomic conditions, unfavorable forex, as well as weakness in digital advertising and gaming. Services revenues grew 6.4% year over year to $20.77 billion in the fiscal first quarter. Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) Apple Inc. revenue-ttm | Apple Inc.

Get it sent directly to your inbox every Wednesday. Subscribe Wednesday, May 3, 2023 Apple could make or break Big Tech&#039;s earnings season Big Tech has, so far, managed to beat Wall Street’s expectations this earnings season. Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META) have largely outperformed analysts’ estimates despite pull backs in consumer and corporate spending. But the industry’s biggest test comes after the bell Thursday when Apple (AAPL) reports its fiscal second quarter earnings results. That’s because the iPhone maker not only serves as a bellwether for the tech sector as a whole, but also on consumer spending. “None of what&#039;s already been reported matters come Thursday night,” explained Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster. “And the reason is ... because [of] the size of Apple, and also it&#039;s been relatively stable too. It&#039;s done a better job of enduring this versus other tech, so if there is a problem, you can throw out all the good news from Microsoft and Google and Meta,” Munster added. Apple CEO Tim Cook gestures at the Apple Fifth Avenue store for the release of the Apple iPhone 14 range in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., September 16, 2022. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly In turn, a solid result from Apple could help buoy the industry and drive up shares of other Big Tech names. But a miss could mean increased pressure on rival tech stocks, just as the sector looks to finally move past its COVID-induced hangover. Apple could swing its rivals Analysts expect Apple to report revenue of $92.6 billion for the second quarter, a 4.8% decline from the $97.3 billion Apple brought in during the same quarter last year. That&#039;s about in line with the 5% decline Apple posted in Q1. “We believe the broader tech industry is all on pins and needles waiting for Apple&#039;s results as many of the tech haters continue to yell fire in a crowded theater around softening demand, with Apple the best barometer globally of this metric,” Wedbush Managing Director Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance via email. Story continues Apple, along with rival Microsoft, has a massive influence on the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC). Together they make up roughly 13% of the index’s market value. Apple, however, outweighs even Microsoft, thanks to its higher market cap of $2.67 trillion. Microsoft’s market cap sits at $2.27 trillion. For investors tracking the S&amp;P 500, a miss by Apple could have an outsized impact on their portfolios. A key to consumer spending While Apple’s enormous size and weight relative to market competitors gives its results added importance, the company’s performance is also a key indicator for consumer spending. “Most, if not all, iPhones are purchased for consumers. Macs, for the most part, are purchased for consumers and/or small, medium businesses,” explained UBS Managing Director David Vogt. “So it&#039;s really more of a bellwether or a barometer regarding high end consumer spending.” A miss on Apple’s revenue, especially for its iPhone business, would mean consumers are spending less and holding back on making large purchases. Worse still would be any signal that revenue will come in weaker than anticipated in Q3. That would signal that Apple anticipates customers will continue to hold back on spending their cash. It all comes down to Thursday night. Buckle up. By Daniel Howley, tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

What to watch for:LAST QUARTER/GUIDANCE: Last quarter, Qualcomm reported Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $2.37 on revenue of $9.46B, compared to analysts&#039; estimates for $2.34 and $9.6B, respectively. Along with the report, the company guided for Q2 adjusted EPS of $2.05-$2.25 on revenue of $8.7B-$9.5B. At the time, analysts were expecting Qualcomm to report Q2 EPS of $2.26 on revenue of $9.55B, but those figures have since fallen to $2.16 and $9.1B, respectively.SUSQUEHANNA UPGRADE: In mid-March, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland upgraded Qualcomm to Positive from Neutral with a price target of $140, up from $130. In April 2021, the firm called for the top of the semiconductor cycle, but in March 2023 called for the bottom in this cycle, at least for consumer, PC, and handset-related names. Asian checks suggest Chinese handset sell-through was better for both January and February, which the analyst calls \"the first positive surprises in our data for over a year.\" Rolland also believes Qualcomm&#039;s push into the midrange \"comes at a fortuitous time given China&#039;s reopening\" and it sees the Apple (AAPL) business as \"now de-risked.\"EU CHIP SUBSIDY PLAN: Last month, the European Commission said it \"welcomed\" a political agreement reached between the European Parliament and the EU Member States on the European Chips Act, proposed by the Commission on February 8, 2022, including on the budget. \"Semiconductors are at the center of strong geostrategic interests, and of the global technological race,\" the EU said. \"For this reason, the Commission proposed the European Chips Act, which strengthens European competitiveness and resilience in this strategic sector... Recent shortages of semiconductors have highlighted Europe&#039;s dependency on a limited number of suppliers outside of the EU, in particular Taiwan and South-East Asia for manufacturing of chips, and the United States for their design. To respond to critical dependencies, the European Chips Act will strengthen manufacturing activities in the Union, stimulate the European design ecosystem, and support scale-up and innovation across the whole value chain. Through the European Chips Act, the European Union aims to reach its target to double its current global market share to 20% in 2030. ...In addition to the Chips for Europe Initiative, the second pillar of the European Chips Act will incentivise public and private investments in manufacturing facilities for chipmakers and their suppliers. This will contribute to the overall public investments in the sector estimated at EUR 43B.\"DIVIDEND: In early March, Qualcomm announced that its Board of Directors has approved a 7% increase in the company&#039;s quarterly cash dividend. The quarterly cash dividend will increase from 75c to 80c per share of common stock and will be effective for quarterly dividends payable after March 23. This dividend increase will raise the annualized dividend payout to $3.20 per share of common stock.More By This Author:\n\n---\n\n[2023-05-04] 2023-05-03 20:29:00\n标题: After Hours Most Active for May 3, 2023 : STAG, AXON, FTI, AAPL, VCSH, JD, PFE, CHGG, VZ, TQQQ, QQQ, EQT\n内容: The NASDAQ 100 After Hours Indicator is up 9.06 to 13,039.27.

After U.S. stock markets closed, Qualcomm (QCOM) said that it expects its third-quarter earnings, excluding one-time items, to be in a range of $1.70 to $1.90 a share, on revenue between $8.1B and $8.9B. Wall Street analysts had previously forecast Qualcomm (QCOM) to earn $2.13 a share on sales of $9.12B. Qualcomm (QCOM) has said it is working to broaden its customer base, and that it expects to significantly reduce its business with Apple (AAPL) through the rest of this year. In a statement with its third-quarter forecast, Qualcomm (QCOM) said it is continuing to see the impact of several factors on in business, including \"macroeconomic headwinds, weaker global handset units, and channel inventory drawdown.\" Additionally, Qualcomm (QCOM) said it expects to see \"a larger-than-normal\" sequential decline in revenue for its QCT division, which includes most of the company&#039;s mobile-phone chipsets and other mobile device products. \"Our top priority remains to execute our diversification strategy and invest in areas that drive long-term value,\" Amon said, in a statement. During its fiscal second quarter, Qualcomm (QCOM) reported earnings, excluding one-time items, of $2.15 a share, on revenue of $9.27B. QCT made up the wide majority of Qualcomm&#039;s (QCOM) quarterly revenue, with sales of $7.9B. Qualcomm&#039;s (QCOM) results topped the estimates of Wall Street analysts, who forecast the company to earn $2.16 a share, excluding one-time items, on $9.12B in revenue. However, while Qualcomm (QCOM) did better than analysts had expected, its results showed business not being able to perform better on a year-over-year basis. During is 2022 fiscal second-quarter, Qualcomm (QCOM) earned $3.21 a share, excluding one-time items, on revenue of $11.16B.

Undoubtedly, the latest product offering to come from Apple’s fintech push comes at a pretty exciting time, at least through the eyes of a potential market disruptor. As Apple wanders deeper into financial services with its disruptor hat on, it’s hard to be anything but bullish on the firm. U.S. Regional Banks Feel Pressure. Apple May Be Seeing an Opportunity The U.S. banks have been under a lot of selling pressure for well over a month now. Indeed, it all started with SVB Financial’s failure. As other regionals fell under the weight of the Fed’s interest rate hikes, a full-blown U.S. regional banking crisis came to be. Bad bond investments eroded depositor confidence, eventually paving the way for a bank run. It’s difficult to tell when this pressure hurting the regional banks will be contained. Over a span of a month and a half, we’ve witnessed the second, third, and fourth-largest bank failures in U.S. history. After such a wave of failures, it’s no mystery why some depositors feel a bit on edge. While larger U.S. banks have mostly been steady in this storm, they too could stand to lose a bit as depositors look to consider alternatives. Of course, there have always been fintech firms, neobanks, and smaller financial institutions that have offered highly-competitive rates on deposits. That said, never before has there been a respected, consumer-centric behemoth of a firm like Apple getting in on the financial services space. Apple’s a $2.65 trillion company that many tech-savvy users already trust day-to-day with their data. For many Apple users, this trust has been built for well over a decade. When it comes to financial services, trust and reliability play a massive role in where depositors or investors choose to take their business. Of course, competitive rates always help, but they’re not always the determining factor. With Apple pulling the curtain on its high-rate savings account, I think the firm could stand to win a lot of business as confidence in banks takes a modest blow with every regional bank that goes down. Apple and Goldman Could Continue to Make Moves in Consumer Banking Apple may be a relative newcomer to the financial services space, but it has all the tools it needs to thrive. With a bit of help from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), I believe Apple is the one firm that could upend the financial industry as we know it. Undoubtedly, the business of banking can be profitable, but it can also be wildly turbulent when the tides turn. With Apple teaming up with Goldman (and perhaps other banks in the future), the firm may find itself with the ability to enjoy more of the feast to be had within financial services minus potential indigestion. At this juncture, many depositors may be inclined to take money out of those sub-2% savings accounts and stash it with Apple, where they can make more than double the interest. Reportedly, 69% of Apple Card holders expressed interest in opening up a savings account. Younger consumers, specifically those in the Millennial and Gen Z cohort, may be inclined to get an Apple Card if it means gaining excess to such a competitive savings account. According to a report conducted by Forbes, Apple’s high-yield savings account brought in nearly $1 billion worth of deposits in just four days. That’s impressive. Apple has a competitive rate, a reputation built on decades of trust, and a brand that’s virtually impossible to match. It’s no mystery why Apple’s foray into banking has been met with such profound early success. Is AAPL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts? Turning to Wall Street, AAPL stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 25 analyst ratings, there are 21 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average Apple price target is $177.23, implying upside potential of 5.8%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $120.00 per share to a high of $205.00 per share. The Bottom Line on Apple Stock and Its Fintech Push Apple has always been about doing things better than the competitors it seeks to go up against. As select banks face a crisis of confidence, I’d look for more people to take their money over to Apple, not just for the higher rate but for greater convenience and more peace of mind. Going into earnings, I’d look for more details about Apple’s fintech push. Even if the quarterly results fail to impress, commentary on Apple’s direction could be a needle-mover for the stock.\n\n---\n\n[2023-05-04] 2023-05-03 22:39:00\n标题: Time to Buy Apple Stock for More Upside as Earnings Approach?\n内容: Edging out some nice gains this year all eyes are on Apple (AAPL) this week with the company set to release its fiscal second-quarter earnings on Thursday, May 4. Apple’s performance has been strong outperforming most of its big tech peers such as Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) while easily topping the broader indexes. With Apple stock now up +30% in 2023, investors are wondering if strong second-quarter results and positive guidance can help the computer and technology innovator divvy up more gains like it is historically known to do. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Q2 Preview Apple’s second-quarter earnings are expected to dip -5% at $1.44 per share compared to EPS of $1.52 in Q2 2022. Sales are forecasted to be down -4% from the prior year quarter at $93.32 billion. Still, Apple’s stock tends to pop after beating earnings expectations and investors are certainly hoping the company can do so. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Wall Street will be monitoring Apple&#039;s guidance to see if operating conditions are stabilizing going forward. Last quarter, CEO Tim Cook stated a stronger dollar, production issues in China, and the broader challenges in the macroeconomic environment affected results. To that point, Apple most recently missed its first quarter top and bottom line expectations by a slight margin. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Notably, Q1 sales missed top-line estimates by -3% and declined -5% YoY which was the largest quarterly drop since 2016 and the first decline in quarterly revenue since 2019. With Apple expected to post another quartely decline in sales, Wall Street will be seeing if the company&#039;s outlook indicates a stop to the bleeding. With that being said, the sentiment toward tech stocks is very positive as inflation begins to ease and the ability to offer positive guidance could extend Apple’s rally. Growth &amp; Outlook According to Zacks estimates, Apple’s sales are now forecasted to be down -1% this year but rebound and rise 7% in FY24 to $414.61 billion. More importantly, fiscal 2024 would be a 59% increase from 2019 pre-pandemic sales of $260.17 billion. On the bottom line, earnings are projected to slightly decline by -1% in FY23 but jump 11% in FY24 at $6.66 per share. Fiscal 2024 would represent a very impressive 124% growth in EPS since the pandemic with 2019 earnings at $2.97 per share. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Performance &amp; Valuation With its growth story seemingly intact, investors may be more intrigued by the strong performance in Apple stock this year. To that point, Apple’s stellar growth has led to the stock soaring +951% over the last decade. This has crushed the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq, while also topping the performance of Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft stocks. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Trading around $168 per share, Apple stock trades at 28X forward earnings which is nicely below its decade-long high of 38.6X but above the median of 16X. Although this is above the industry average of 9.1X and the S&amp;P 500’s 18.9X, Apple is the clear-cut leader in its space and Wall Street has historically been ok with paying a premium for AAPL shares due to the company’s growth potential. Plus, when considering Apple’s growth rate its PEG ratio of 2.1 is slightly below the industry average and not too far above the S&amp;P 500’s 1.72 although the optimum level is less than 1.0. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Bottom Line Apple stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) going into its fiscal second quarter report. Looking at Apple’s historical performance and the expected growth next year there could still be a nice amount of upside from current levels. However, more upside in Apple stock will largely depend on the company’s ability to offer positive or better-than-expected guidance and put an end to the decline in quarterly sales.

Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who has been vociferous throughout the development, discussed the crisis again in a lengthy tweet.What Happened: The regional banking system is at risk, said Ackman, who runs the hedge fund Pershing Square. Silicon Valley Bank&#039;s collapse served as a warning for uninsured depositors and the rapid rise in rates \"impaired assets and drained assets, he said.\"Zeroing out shareholders and bondholders massively increased banks&#039; cost of capital,\" the fund manager said.He also warned of looming commercial real estate losses. Incidentally, Warren Buffett&#039;s trusted lieutenant Charlie Munger recently sounded out a similar alarm.The unsavory development on the banking front has resulted in the emergence of higher-yielding, more user-friendly alternatives such as Apple, Inc.&#039;s AAPL savings account announced recently. Reports suggest the tech giant was successful in amassing nearly $1 billion in deposits within four days of the launch.Government’s Failure? By refusing to update and expand Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation&#039;s insurance regime, the federal agency has worsened the situation, Ackman said. After SVB&#039;s collapse, Ackman was among those who called upon the FDIC to announce a 100% guarantee. First Republic would not have failed if the FDIC temporarily guaranteed deposits while working on a new guarantee regime, the fund manager said.\"Instead, we watch the dominoes fall at a great systemic and economic cost.\"\"Banking is a confidence game,\" Ackman said, adding that \"at this rate, no regional bank can survive bad news or bad data, as a stock price plunge inevitably follows.\"Insured and insured deposits are then withdrawn, forcing the banks to explore strategic alternatives, he said. This means an FDIC shutdown over the coming weekend, he added.Advantage Big Banks: Ackman noted that the globally systemically important banks have an unfair competitive advantage as \"too-big-to-fail\" means only their uninsured depositors can sleep soundly. He sees regional banks at \"grave risk\" until the \"playing field is leveled.\"Time Running Out: \"As each domino falls, the next weakest bank begins to wobble,\" Ackman said. Unless buyers are rewarded for betting on a wobbling bank, he suggested that there would be no bids, and it would be sold at throwaway prices.\"We are running out of time to fix the problem,\" Ackman said, adding that \"we need a systemwide deposit guarantee regime now.”Ackman&#039;s rant comes against the backdrop of PacWest Bancorp&#039;s PACW announcement that it is exploring strategic options. This sent the stock tumbling by over 52% in the after-hours session on Wednesday. First Republic folded up early this week and was sold to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM.

It Looks to Extend Big Tech’s Streak.\n内容: Wall Street analysts expect that Apple sales fell 4.5% in the company’s latest quarter. Getty Images Apple is set to close out Big Tech earnings Thursday after the market closes. The iPhone maker is expected to report another year-over-year sales decline for the March quarter. Shares of Apple (ticker: AAPL) have soared nearly 31% in 2023, though the stock is up just 2.4% over the past 12 months. The S&amp;P 500 is up 7.7% this year and down 3.9% in the past 12 months. So far, Big Tech earnings have been fairly positive. Reports from Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Meta Platforms (META) were mostly well received by Wall Street. Amazon.com ‘s results topped estimates but a weak outlook around the cloud sent shares falling. Apple investors are hoping the firm follows in Microsoft’s footsteps, and not Amazon’s. “With Big Tech showing impressive resiliency during earnings season the last few weeks now the baton is handed to Cook as investors all look towards Apple’s Thursday night print/guidance with the tech finale on 1Q,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote on Monday. For Apple’s fiscal second quarter, the consensus among analysts polled by FactSet calls for earnings of $1.43 a share. Analysts expect sales fell 4.5% to $92.91 billion. Ives rates Apple at Outperform with a $205 price target. He wrote Monday that he thinks an uptick in demand in China will help drive upside for iPhone sales. “With an App Store uptick this quarter we also believe Services revenue should be stable and combined should translate into headline numbers from Cupertino that should at least meet the Street’s expectations,” Ives wrote. J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee, who rates Apple at Overweight with a $190 price target, wrote Wednesday that investors will be especially interested in the firm’s commentary about the current quarter. The FactSet consensus call for the June quarter is for earnings of $1.21 a share and sales of $84.5 billion.

Apple (AAPL) Earnings Preview: Bull vs. Bear Case Apple, the unequivocal king of the stock market reports earnings Thursday, May 4 after the market closes. As the world’s leading consumer products and technology company, Apple’s earnings act as an important bellwether for the broader economy. Apple stock has not disappointed this year and the sturdiness of Apple’s returns simply cannot be understated. The stock is up 30% YTD, 300% over the last five years, and 1100% over the last 10 years. It isn’t flawless though, as it was down -30% during 2022. However, it has nearly earned it all back in the first four months of 2023. Earnings Expectations Analysts are expecting a YoY decline in Q2 sales, which isn’t great, but also not terrible. Something I don’t often see mentioned about Apple is the strong seasonal tendencies of its revenues. In the quarterly revenues chart below we see revenues regularly explode higher following the holiday season and are then mostly stagnant through the rest of the year. But Q1 2023 sales were below Q1 2022, which shows that there was a YoY slowdown in the most recent holiday season. Additionally, analyst earnings revisions have been mixed, which gives Apple a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Q2 expectations are looking down a bit, which lines up with market expectations of a broader economic slowdown in the second half of the year. Also concerning, last quarter Apple posted a rare sales and earnings miss. Last quarter marked Apple’s first earnings miss since 2016, which was just -$0.01 below expectations and its second sales miss since 2016, which was also just below expectations. Analysts are expecting earnings growth to decline -5.3% YoY to $1.44 a share. The rest of the year is expected to be mostly flat as well, however next year’s earnings are projected to pick up significantly. Bear Case Shorting Apple is almost never advised, and although I don’t consider this my base case it is important to address the primary risks. AAPL stock has acted as an incredible haven this year and its returns make up 25% of S&amp;P 500’s total returns YTD. At this point investors are treating Apple stock like a Treasury bond, and it has considerably outperformed Treasuries. But is that realistic? Will some doubt start creeping into investors’ minds and cause Apple to roll over. Apple’s most critical profit center is the iPhone, which makes up 52% of total revenue. In the Q1 report, we saw that iPhone sales were down YoY. Management chalked this up to a one-time event and blamed the miss on supply issues related to the lockdowns in China. What if it was a demand issue though? What if we are moving past peak iPhone? The chart below shows total annual smartphone sales, which have clearly peaked. This means that Apple is already fighting an uphill battle. Furthermore, iPhone quality and longevity is improving, and so are prices, and the length of payment plans. I know personally, the iPhone 11 Pro I bought in 2019 still feels as good as new. Market share is another important consideration. Apple currently has an impressive 23% market share of global smartphones. How much room does Apple have to continue to grow this figure? The massive Chinese middle class is a very important segment for Apple to target, but what if they start to prefer the Chinese branded phones? Oppo and Xiaomi have made some extremely compelling new phones, particularly their smart flip phones. Flip phones are extremely interesting because they begin to blend phone and tablet products. Flip phones are a product Apple doesn’t have and I haven’t heard rumors of anything in the pipeline. The black swan event would be a military conflict between the US and China. In this worst case scenario, it would be highly unlikely that the civil relations between Apple and China continue. The concerns listed are more hypotheticals and questions. Of course, Apple has defied all investor logic for over a decade now, and its downfall is an extremely unlikely event. But doubt and fear can move a stock. Is the next 20% move in Apple stock higher or lower? I don’t know, but there are certainly catalysts the give potential to the -20% possibility. Technicals There isn’t a clean chart pattern to trade AAPL from, but this large range looks significant to me. The $180 level is resistance and $130 support. Right now, price is in no-mans land in the middle of this large range. If price can clear the $180 level, resistance should turn into support, and the next multi-year leg higher in Apple should commence. However, a rejection at $180 would be very significant. If the stock can’t clear that level, it may be indicative of not just Apple, but the market more broadly. With a recession likely coming later this year, it is possible we will see Apple retest the high of the range, and then as the recession takes hold, swing back down to the bottom of the range. Rather than trying to short the stock, investors would be better off waiting for price to come back down to the $130-$140 buy zone. Valuation Apple is currently trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 28x, which is above the market average and above its five-year median of 24x. This certainly isn’t a cheap valuation, but as one of the world’s leading companies it isn’t particularly expensive either. This reasonable valuation doesn’t play well for the bears. Bottom Line Apple is a juggernaut in the stock market, and its supremacy is undeniable. While I did lay out a bear case, it is more of an exercise in risk management than anything else. While the dynamics that have propelled Apple to this level over the past decade may change, the biggest risk currently is an economic slowdown. Apple brought luxury to the masses, so if the average person begins to feel the heat of a slowing economy, they probably won’t be buying a new iPhone. But there is a path where the recession is not too bad, and in that case, Apple continues to chug along as the world’s leading stock. Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks&#039; Top Stocks?

But the true greats like Warren Buffett are both. His holding company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) began buying shares of iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in 2016. That investment has grown into the holding company&#039;s most significant position through sheer outperformance. That&#039;s a heck of a stock pick. Buffett didn&#039;t realize it then, but fast-forward seven years and artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the economy as we speak. And as luck would have it, Berkshire&#039;s largest position, a whopping $155 billion stake in Apple, has Berkshire positioned to benefit from all that AI has to offer. Here is what you need to know. AI clues in Apple&#039;s products Apple has built an empire as a consumer electronics brand. It sells smartphones, computers, earbuds, and other accessories, followed by a variety of subscription services to help keep consumers locked into its ecosystem. From digital wallets to music, news, exercise, and gaming, there is a service for just about every digital need -- all accessible through your favorite Apple device. Today there are an estimated 1.5 billion active iPhone users alone, a massive user base that allows Apple to launch a new service and rapidly grow it. For example, Apple launched a buy now, pay later service, and with a simple iOS update, it can peddle it to as many users as it wants. This ecosystem is Apple&#039;s competitive advantage, and protecting it is the company&#039;s secret to long-term prosperity. Apple hasn&#039;t made waves in AI like some other big tech companies, but it&#039;s undoubtedly creeping into Apple&#039;s user services. Here are some examples: Photo editing features such as removing objects/backgrounds Predictive text on the keyboard Face ID with masks Crash detection in automobiles These changes all contribute to a better user experience, making it more likely you will continue upgrading your devices to the next generation. The system made Apple one of the decade&#039;s best investments. Could Siri become a game-changer? Much of the recent attention on AI centers around ChatGPT and other large language models, or chatbots, which can source information and reply to queries with conversation-like replies. Ironically, Apple had already broached this with its voice assistant Siri in 2011. The software has evolved, but most iPhone users are probably familiar with its limited capabilities. But integrating ChatGPT-like intelligence into Siri would be a potential game-changer, helping the voice assistant realize the potential that users have been waiting over a decade for. It was recently reported that Apple&#039;s engineers are actively looking at technologies like what powers ChatGPT. Though nothing is announced or imminent, it&#039;s an exciting possibility worth keeping an eye on. Should investors follow Warren&#039;s lead? Fortunately, you don&#039;t need AI to justify owning Apple stock -- the company&#039;s dominant ecosystem is plenty. However, there are some things you should consider before buying shares today. For example, Warren Buffett bought the stock for Berkshire in early 2016 when shares traded near a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of just 10. It turned out to be the cheapest valuation Apple would trade at ever since. Today shares trade at a P/E of nearly 30, which complicates things. Analysts believe Apple&#039;s earnings-per-share (EPS) growth will hover around 10% annually, making it harder to pull the trigger when the S&amp;P 500, which historically averages 10% annual returns, trades at a much lower valuation. AAPL PE Ratio data by YCharts Investors might benefit from waiting for shares to cool off after appreciating 30% since the start of the year. Many economists believe the U.S. is entering a recession, and the potential market turbulence might create a better buying opportunity. Be sure to keep Apple on your watchlist, though; the future is still bright for Buffett&#039;s (and Berkshire&#039;s) biggest holding. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Another rout in regional U.S. bank shares overnight was hardly helping spirits, but with gold XAU= a whisker away from a record high and oil LCOc1 higher after a tough few days, focus was naturally on Frankfurt. Economists polled by Reuters expect the ECB to raise its borrowing rates for a seventh meeting in a row albeit the consensus is for a smaller quarter-point move rather than the half-point jumps it has been favouring recently. Matt Ward, a portfolio manager in the global equities team at Barings, said after the Fed had done a decent job \"threading the needle\" on Wednesday with its quarter point rise, the ECB would be watched closely. \"I am not in the camp of expecting a shock 50 basis point hike, but it&#039;s tough to see anything but a continuation of the hawkish tone,\" he said, pointing to the run of relatively robust data and low unemployment in key countries like Germany. That likely ECB tone was evident in the bond markets where benchmark government bond yields, which drive the cost of borrowing across Europe, were nudging higher. It was fractional stuff though. Germany&#039;s 10-year yield DE10YT=RR was up just 1 basis point at 2.26% and well down from where it was a month ago, while Italy&#039;s IT10YT=RR was only 2 bps higher at 4.152%. GVD/EUR \"We&#039;re basically in limbo right now until the decision,\" which comes at 1215 GMT, said Piet Haines Christiansen, chief strategist for fixed income at Danske Bank. The Fed on Wednesday dropped a key line that had been in its previously statements on the need for further rate increases, yet Fed Chair Jerome Powell pushed back against expectations that it will soon start cutting them. It will \"take some time\" for inflation to fall he said, so \"it would not be appropriate to cut rates\" this year. It came too as another U.S. regional bank, PacWest Bancorp PACW.O, reported troubles, reminding investors of the precarious health of some banks despite regulators&#039; assurances around containing the crisis that started with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March. \"The Fed decision was widely expected, so it didn&#039;t provide much of a shock to financial markets,\" said Tina Teng, market analyst at CMC Markets, in Auckland. \"However, I think the whole economic playout is not positive, especially the recent banking rout from the regional banks.\" APPLE EYED Frontrunning the ECB, Norway&#039;s central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.25%, as expected, and added it was likely to hike again in June, and beyond if the Norwegian crown stays weak. European stocks languished, with the STOXX 600 STOXX down 0.5% led by the carmaking and tourism sectors. .EU MSCI&#039;s 47-country index of world shares was slipping back into the red too .MIWD00000PUS as were Wall Street futures were tech giant Apple AAPL.O was due to reports earnings later. Asia had been more upbeat .MIAPJ0000PUS although trade has been thinned this week by Japanese holidays. China&#039;s benchmark index .CSI300 opened weaker as mainland markets returned after their May Day holidays but rebounded to end broadly unchanged. U.S. bond markets had rallied on Wednesday after the Fed meeting TYc1, as did Fed Funds futures 0#FF:, the latter implying a 52% chance of a rate cut as early as July. The Japanese yen JPY=EBS strengthened 0.1% versus the greenback at 134.51 per dollar, adding to its more than 1% rise on Wednesday. Back in Europe, the euro EUR=EBS turned lower having briefly flirting with a one-year peak, while Britain&#039;s pound GBP=D3 also went flat having touched a roughly 11-month high of $1.25925 in Asia. /FRX Mizuho analysts said the excitement over the implied pause in Fed tightening might be overdone and that the Fed&#039;s guidance \"is merely more contemplative\". Brent oil prices rose 1% to $72.83 a barrel on Thursday but it was a fraction of their 9% slump seen over past three days.

GOOG GOOGL has boldly moved towards a passwordless future with the announcement that users may soon not even need to use or remember their passwords. What Happened: Google has started rolling out passkey support for all major platforms, providing users with an extra login option alongside passwords and two-step verification or 2SV. It is now an option for users who want to try a “passwordless sign-in experience.”“So maybe by next year’s World Password Day, you won’t even need to use your password, much less remember it!” the company stated in a blog post on Wednesday. See Also: Disgruntled Google Employees Rain Down Memes To Mock CEO Sundar Pichai’s Enormous $226M SalaryAt present, Google is extending its “passwordless” support to consumer devices, with business accounts on Google Workspace expected to receive this option in the future. According to Google, passkeys offer a more secure and user-friendly method to sign in to websites and apps, eliminating the need for easily guessable passwords like “password123.” It allows users to authenticate their identity through fingerprint, face scan, or screen lock PIN — the same way you unlock your devices — and make them resilient against phishing attacks compared to traditional passwords and one-time SMS codes. “Over the past year we’ve shared updates on bringing passkey experiences to both Chrome and Android, which services like DocuSign, Kayak, PayPal, Shopify and Yahoo! Japan have already deployed to streamline sign-in for their users,” the company stated. Why It’s Important: Last year, Apple Inc. AAPL, Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Google came together to support a new sign-in standard by the FIDO Alliance. At the time, the open industry association stated that this approach would protect users from getting trapped by phishing attempts and the sign-in process will become radically more secure. However, at this point, it is uncertain how successful the new approach is in terms of easing users’ problems with remembering passwords and keeping their communications secure.

AAPL is the last among the FAANGs to report its March quarter results. The results are important because they could confirm or question the strength of quarterly reports from other big techs.Key Q2 Expectations: Cupertino, California-based Apple is expected to report earnings per share of $1.43 per share on revenue of $92.96 billion. The consensus EPS estimate of $1.43 suggests a 5.92% drop from the year ago&#039;s $1.52 and a roughly 24% drop from the previous quarter&#039;s $1.88. Street revenue estimate of $92.96 would mark a 4.4% drop from the year-ago quarter&#039;s $97.28 billion and a 20.7% decline from the first quarter&#039;s $117.2 billion. It has to be noted here that the second quarter is one of Apple&#039;s seasonally slow quarters, coming right after the holiday-selling period.In a recent note, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said that he expects in-line March quarter results.Citing continued uncertainty, Apple refrained from giving revenue guidance for the second quarter. CFO Lucas Maestri said on the first-quarter earnings calls that the company expects revenue performance similar to the December quarter and forex to continue to be a headwind. Woodring said he expects Apple to announce a $90 billion incremental buyback authorization and a 5% year-over-year increase in dividends.See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Apple StockBusiness Segments: iPhone revenue is likely to come in line or slightly higher than estimates, most analysts say. Wedbush&#039;s Daniel Ives said he sees some upside in iPhone shipments, thanks to a clear uptick in demand in China. Higher average selling prices and overall upgrade activity should help, he added.Ives estimates ASPs of around $900-$925 for the quarter.Woodring expects iPhone revenue of $50.3 billion, with shipments at 54.5 million and ASPs at $922 due to a strong high-end mix. This should help offset the effect of some discounting in the international markets, he added.The Morgan Stanley analyst recently trimmed his Mac shipment forecast from 4.8 million units to 4.3 million units, consequently taking down the product’s revenue estimate by 10% to $6.3 billion.Woodring expects Services revenue to come in at $20.9 billion, up 5.7% year-over-year and 20 basis points above the consensus. Ives forecasts stable Services revenue due to an uptick in App Store revenue.Deepwater Asset Management&#039;s Gene Munster said investors are also likely to focus on the active installed base, which rose 8% year-over-year to over 2 billion in the first quarter.“A growing base means the Apple product flywheel is working,” Munster said.June Quarter Could Be Soft: Morgan Stanley&#039;s Woodring expects June quarter revenue of $80.3 billion, marking a 3% year-over-year decline. This is below the consensus estimate of $84.71 billion.He premised his expectation on 41 million units of iPhone shipment and a $901 ASP and lower Mac, iPad and Services revenue. The variance of June quarter revenue vis-à-vis consensus is primarily due to Woodring’s softer iPhone revenue forecast at $37.2 billion.Build strength in April and May could weaken as the trough of the iPhone 14 cycle approaches, he said.Morgan Stanley, however, expects a better-than-consensus gross margin forecast for the quarter due to more favorable forex comparisons and further operational expenditure discipline.Read Next: Can Tesla Beat Apple In Market Value? Analyst Points To ‘Huge Missed Opportunity’Apple Stock: Apple shares have gained 29.1% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 Index, which added 6.5% during the same period.Woodring noted that a March quarter beat and June quarter guide down have not historically produced a negative post-earnings stock reaction. Investors typically look past the trough of the cycle to the upcoming iPhone launch.Munster said Apple&#039;s investment case will likely shift to a consumer staples company that should yield a higher multiple. \"On top of that, Apple is making meaningful progress in AI, a dynamic that is under-appreciated by investors,\" he added.The average analysts&#039; price target for Apple stock, according to TipRanks, is $177.23%, suggesting a roughly 6% upside from current levels.In premarket trading on Thursday, Apple shares fell 1.06% to $165.67, according to\n\n---\n\n[2023-05-04] 2023-05-04 10:08:18\n标题: S&P Settles Lower After Fed Raises Rates; Market Volatility Increases Sharply\n内容: The S&amp;P 500 closed lower on Wednesday after the Fed raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

For the second-quarter, Power expects Apple (AAPL) to generate $1.41 per share in earnings and $92.1B in revenue, including $47.9B from the iPhone. In addition, Apple (AAPL) is expected to update its capital return policy, with Power expecting it to \"mirror\" recent years updates, including a higher buyback and \"slightly higher\" dividend. Power noted that Apple (AAPL) is currently trading at 27.8 times 2023 estimated earnings and 26.3 times 2024 estimated earnings, while the S&amp;P 500 is trading at roughly 19 times estimated earnings. This is the highest premium relative to the S&amp;P 500 since 2020. J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee, who has an overweight rating on Apple (AAPL) said there is a \"divergence\" of the earnings print compared to estimate changes and the share price, given there is \"fundamental weakness\" in hardware. \"We see the combination of downside to revenue earnings being limited despite being in a tough macro; dividend and buyback support to total return as well as earnings growth; and AAPL shares trading at 26x NTM P/E, within the recent trading range of 22x-30x, and below the peak multiple of 30x, reinforcing that valuations still have room despite outperformance of the shares [year-to-date], all supporting a positive outcome for the share price that diverges from the estimate revisions expected coming out of the print,\" Chatterjee wrote. For the quarter, Chatterjee expects better iPhone revenue thanks to channel builds after last year&#039;s inventory constraints, but guidance may be an issue as the global economic weakness continues. Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan is expecting an \"inline quarter,\" but guidance may be weaker-than-thought as consumer spending continues to slow. \"We see iPhone sales stable (no major supply chain cuts) with some tailwind from demand pushed from [fiscal first-quarter] to [fiscal second-quarter] given supply issues last qtr,\" Mohan, who has a neutral rating on the stock, wrote. However, Mohan added that other categories, including the iPad, Mac and wearables, are slowing, suggesting consumer spending is weakening. A consensus of analysts expect Apple (AAPL) to earn $1.43 per share and $92.84B in revenue.

The index futures point to a mixed opening on Thursday, as the tech space exuded optimism ahead of Apple, Inc.’s AAPL earnings report. That said, continuing negative headlines on banks could act as a dampener.Cues From Wednesday’s Trading: Stocks ended Wednesday’s session notably lower, with the sentiment turning markedly negative after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference. Expectedly, the Federal Open Market Committee unanimously decided to raise rates by 25 basis points to 5-5.25%, the highest in 16 years, but the post-meeting policy statement left out the references to further monetary policy tightening.Powell dampened sentiment by suggesting in the press conference that Inflation may not come down quickly.The S&amp;P 500 Index and the Nasdaq Composite hovered mostly above the unchanged line until late trading before pulling back. The Dow Industrials was seen hugging the unchanged line for the better part of the session, flitting in and out of the flat line in a narrow range. The 30-stock blue-chip average plunged in late-afternoon trading.With Wednesday’s pullback, the averages are all at a one-week low. The sell-off was broad-based, cutting across sectors. Energy stocks served as the biggest drag, as oil continued its downward spiral below the $70-a-barrel mark. Financial stocks also pulled back notably as the banking crisis continue to play out. Among other sectors that experienced heavy sell-offs were materials, IT and consumer stocks.

However, the market is pricing in rate cuts by the end of the year,” she said.“Investors should remain cautiously optimistic.

Photo: Reuters / Carlos Barria. Apple (AAPL) After the bell in the US, Apple will report its second-quarter earnings with investors expecting year-over-year revenue growth to be similar to the first-quarter (Q1), as previously stated by the tech giant. It said on its last earnings call that sales of Macs and iPads would probably fall by double digits as a result of the “challenging” economic environment. Analysts expect Apple to report revenue of $92.6bn ( 73.64bn) for the second-quarter, a 4.8% decline from the $97.3bn it brought in during the same quarter last year. That&#039;s about in line with the 5% decline Apple posted in Q1. Read more: Apple could make or break Big Tech&#039;s earnings season However, recent big tech earnings have so far managed to beat expectations. For example, Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META) all largely outperformed analysts’ estimates, despite pull backs in consumer and corporate spending. “None of what&#039;s already been reported matters come Thursday night,” explained Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster. “And the reason is ... because [of] the size of Apple, and also it&#039;s been relatively stable too. It&#039;s done a better job of enduring this versus other tech, so if there is a problem, you can throw out all the good news from Microsoft and Google and Meta,” Munster added. Shell (SHEL.L) Shares in Shell were up nearly 2% at the time of writing in morning London trade after the energy giant reported a positive financial update. It posted first-quarter adjusted earnings of $9.65bn, which beat analysts’ expectations for $8.14bn. It was also higher than its profit in the first-quarter of 2022 ($9.13bn), when Russia first invaded Ukraine. Moreover, the oil giant kept its share buyback programme unchanged at $4bn over the next three months. Read more: Shell makes nearly 1.4bn more than expected in opening quarter Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said: “Strong trading amid the volatile price environment in Europe and America helped Shell’s earnings outpace analysts’ expectations and offset the impact of weaker oil and gas prices and lower refining margins. Its chemicals result also improved, driven by better margins thanks to lower utility and feedstock costs. Story continues “Unlike BP, Shell maintained its share buyback programme, returning further cash to shareholders. Over the past year though, shares in Shell are up around 7.5%, underperforming BP which is up nearly 18%,” she added. PacWest (PACW) Shares in US mid-sized lender PacWest plunged more than 50% on Wednesday after traders digested media reports of a potential sale. PacWest has since confirmed that it has been approached by partners and investors – and also noted that it is considering selling strategic assets. The group also sought to reassure investors by saying it had not suffered out-of-the-ordinary deposit outflows, unlike rival First Republic Bank which saw depositors withdraw $100bn. Read more: FTSE and European stocks open lower ahead of ECB rate decision “Less than two months ago, PacWest received a $1.4bn cash injection from Atlas SP Partners following the collapse of SVB, which sparked negative reverberations across the sector,” Victoria Scholar highlighted. Furthermore, she noted how First Republic Bank was rescued by JPMorgan with the Wall Street lender’s CEO Jamie Dimon saying this week that ‘there may be another smaller one’ ahead, referring to a risk of another potential banking collapse. “PacWest is the latest lender to fall victim to the turmoil in the US mid-cap banking sector with worried investors either cutting their holdings or adding to short positions which has punished its share price. PacWest has a heavy focus on commercial real estate lending, which has suffered on the back of the Fed’s aggressive rate hiking path after the longstanding punchbowl of cheap money was removed,” she added. PacWest stock has tumbled from a 52-week high of $34.68 to a low of $6.42 at yesterday’s close. Next (NXT.L) Shares in fashion retailer Next rose 2.06% on Thursday morning on the FTSE 100 after traders were encouraged by its latest trading update. The company maintained its guidance for annual profit after reporting a smaller decline in first-quarter sales of 0.7%, rather than the 2% fall it had expected, in the 13 weeks to 29 April. The fashion retailer expects full year pre-tax profit to be 795m and earnings per share of 501.9p. “While Next’s latest sales update was moderately ahead of its prior expectations, it is nothing to get excited about. Sales growth has stalled and the only area where it is making decent gains is from the income attached to customer credit accounts,” Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said. Mould also noted that Next has a serious growth problem and said that while it may remain a profitable business, a company of its calibre is expected to show financial progression year after year. “Repeated guidance for an 8.7% decline in full-year pre-tax profit suggests the business needs to pull a rabbit out of the hat to regain its mojo,” he added.

Its shares have returned about 7% just in the past thirty days, pushing the tech giant past a $2.5 trillion valuation. Is it time to take profits or can its momentum continue? These answers will be more clear when the company reports second quarter fiscal 2023 earnings results after the closing bell Thursday. It appears the tech giant has its mojo back after licking its wounds in 2022. Even with these strong returns, it’s hard to ignore the many catalysts that can keep shares rising. Last week, in partnership with Goldman Sachs (GS), Apple announced its entry into the banking system by offering a high-interest (4.15%) savings account for Apple Card holders. Also as part of its growing streaming investments, during the quarter Apple begun a 10-year partnership with Major League Soccer, launching MLS Season Pass which gives soccer fans access to every live MLS regular season game as well as the playoffs and MLS Cup. Let’s not forget Apple’s new line of hardware products such as the new MacBook Pro which are powered by the company’s new M2 Pro and M2 Max chips. These models offer not only robust performance, but they also use less energy which elongates battery life. Inflation continues to drive higher operating expenses for Apple, which remains a headwind for its profit margins. While iPhone sales generate a sizable portion of revenues, Apple’s collective high-margin Services businesses continue to grow. It remains to be seen if the Services segment, which generated 70%+ margins in 2022, can power the company through any near-term inflationary headwinds. In the three months that ended March, Wall Street expect the Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant to earn $1.43 per share on revenue of $92.98 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to $1.52 per share on revenue of $97.28 billion. For the full year, ending in October, earnings are expected to decline 2.6% year over year to $5.95 per share, while full-year revenue of $387.92 billion will decline 1.6% year over year. The tech giant has benefited from, among other things, the re-opening of China, its second-largest market. However, when it comes to the U.S., there is still concern regarding the strength of the consumer amid rising inflation and a possible recession. This continues to raise the question whether the company, which is highly reliant on iPhone sales, can ever return to its glory days of high growth. Elsewhere, another question is if Apple’s Services segment will grow fast enough to make up for any weakness in hardware, driven weak worldwide PC sales. Worldwide PC shipments reached 65.3 million units in Q4, falling close to 30% year over year. For the year, PC shipments declined more than 16% year over year. These weaknesses were felt in Q1 when Apple’s Mac revenue of $7.74 billion declined 28% year over year to $7.74 billion. Meanwhile, Q1 iPhone revenue of $65.78 billion declined 8% year over year to $65.78 billion. The weakness led to a quarterly miss on both the top and bottom lines, with the company earnings an adjusted EPS of $1.88 which missed by 7 cents, while Q1 revenue of $117.15 billion declined 5.5% year over year, missing estimates by $4.5 billion. It wasn’t all bad news, however. Apple’s overall install base crossed 2 billion active devices, hitting all-time high for all major product categories. What’s more, Services revenue, which includes subscriptions to products such as Apple TV+, iCloud storage and Apple Music, rose 6.3% year over year, reaching a record of $20.76 billion. On Thursday investors will be watching closely to see whether (or how) inflation might have impacted spending on Apple’s pricey hardware.

The company, which supplies to top handset makers Apple Inc AAPL.O and Samsung Electronics 005930.KS, was set to lose about $10 billion in market valuation, if the losses hold. Qualcomm&#039;s quarterly revenue outlook was the second time a chip firm has underwhelmed Wall Street this week. Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O slumped more than 9% on Wednesday after a dour forecast. \"While we believe investors were expecting a miss, this was admittedly a somewhat sobering report,\" said Bernstein analysts, among the 13 brokerages that cut price targets on Qualcomm&#039;s stock. The company blamed the weakness on the timing of purchases by a customer that only buys its cellular modems and China, where an expected post-COVID recovery was yet to materialize. Qualcomm did not name the modem customer, but analysts pointed to Apple, which will report results after markets close. \"The next two quarterly estimates will be adversely impacted by Apple as this leading modem-only customer purchased modems from Qualcomm in greater volumes earlier than normal due to the supply chain issues,\" said Michael Walkley of Canaccord Genuity. China will remain a headache with no timeline for a recovery there, while competition is deepening from Taiwan&#039;s MediaTek 2454.TW in the high-end smartphone chips, analysts said. \"We worry about customers mixing lower now that wafers are no longer scarce as well as increasing competition from Mediatek at the higher end,\" brokerage Evercore ISI said. Still, there were some encouraging signs for Qualcomm. Automotive revenue jumped 20% and the internet-of-things unit reported in line sales, indicating that Qualcomm&#039;s efforts to diversify away from the smartphone market were on track.

Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya, who has an underperform rating and per-share price target of $100 on Qorvo (QRVO), noted the implied second-half revenue guidance was 8% above estimates, perhaps due to \"incremental\" content win from Apple (AAPL) and the continued clearing of channel inventory. While the smartphone market is still struggling in certain spots, with any rebound in China seen as \"muted,\" the company said Chinese Android sales may have at least bottomed in March. \"While [the March quarter] could be the trough in China Android sales, we continue to wait to see trajectory of rebound in China (visibility often low) and monitor clearing of channel/high cost balance sheet inventory (needed for [gross margin] reacceleration going forward),\" Arya wrote in an investor note. Looking to the June quarter, Qorvo (QRVO) said it expects revenue to be between $620M and $660M, above the $651.19M consensus. It also expects adjusted gross margin of approximately 41.5% and adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately 15 cents per share, compared to a consensus of 18 cents per share. KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh, who has a sector weight rating on Qorvo (QRVO), noted the results and guidance \"bucked\" the weak results from smartphone-related semiconductor companies, as it made \"meaningful: progress in cleaning Android-related inventory. Vinh also noted that the company&#039;s gross margins are expected to rise roughly 400 basis points in the fiscal second-quarter, thanks to a seasonal ramp, while falling between 100 and 150 basis points in the third-quarter and 200 to 300 basis points in the fourth-quarter. Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland, who has a neutral rating on Qorvo (QRVO), said he was \"positively surprised\" by the results, even if there is still a way to go in the recovery. \"[W]e expected a weaker quarter for Qorvo, but were positively surprised as content, seasonality and inventory clearing set up a stronger September,\" Rolland wrote, who also boosted his per-share price target to $105 from $100.

PacWest Bancorp PACW.O tumbled 37.2% in premarket trading on Thursday after it confirmed it was exploring strategic options, including a sale, after shares of the regional lender and peers got hammered amid fears of a worsening banking crisis. Regulators seized troubled First Republic Bank and JPMorgan Chase JPM.N agreed to buy majority of its assets earlier this week, marking the largest U.S. bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis. Shares of other regional lenders such as KeyCorp KEY.N, Valley National Bancorp VLY.O and Zions Bancorp ZION.O fell between 7.7% and 9.6% on Thursday, while Western Alliance Bancorp WAL.N dropped 13.4% despite noting that it had not experienced unusual deposit outflows following the sale of First Republic. \"PacWest is more evidence that the U.S. banking crisis is not over yet,\" said Stuart Cole, chief macro economist at Equiti Capital. \"It (PacWest) does appear that it is struggling, and I would be very surprised if it was not for the same reasons as those before it ... the market is circling all these regional U.S. banks like a vulture, looking which one to pick off next.\" The U.S. central bank on Wednesday raised interest rates by 25 basis points to the 5.00%-5.25% range and signaled a pause in its policy tightening, giving officials time to assess the recent bank failures, U.S. debt ceiling situation and sticky inflation. However, U.S. stocks dropped on Wednesday after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that it was too soon to say with certainty that the rate-hike cycle was over as inflation remains the chief concern. U.S. interest rate futures priced in a pause in tightening at the Fed&#039;s June and July policy meetings, according to the CME&#039;s FedWatch tool, and also factored in a nearly 50% chance of rate cuts at the September meeting. Although the end of Fed&#039;s market-punishing rate-hike cycle may be in sight, uncertainty over stock valuations and the economic outlook are keeping investors on alert for more turbulence ahead. Major technology and growth stocks such as Meta Platforms Inc META.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O edged up on Thursday, helped by a fall in U.S. Treasury yields. US/ The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits increased last week as the labor market gradually softens amid higher interest rates, which are cooling demand in the economy.

Read what the most accurate analysts are saying here...From a technical analysis perspective, Apple’s stock looked bullish heading into the event, having formed the next possible higher low within an uptrend pattern on Thursday. It should be noted that holding stocks or options over an earnings print is akin to gambling because stocks can react bullishly to an earnings miss and bearishly to an earnings beat.Options traders, particularly those who are holding close-dated calls or puts, take on the extra risk because the institutions writing the options increase premiums to account for implied volatility.Want direct analysis?

Apple’s most recent higher high was formed on Wednesday at $170.92 and the most recent confirmed higher low was printed at the $162.80 mark on April 26. On Thursday, Apple gapped down, but bulls came in to buy the dip. If Apple receives a bullish reaction to its earnings print, Thursday’s low-of-day may serve as the next higher low within the pattern, making the uptrend likely to continue. If Apple suffers a bearish reaction to the news and falls under $162, the uptrend will be negated and a downtrend may be on the horizon. If that happens, the stock may find support, at least temporarily, at the 50-day simple moving average. Apple has resistance above at $167.88 and $171.03 and support below at $162.14 and $158.09.

Apple said sales for its fiscal second quarter ended April 1 fell 2.5% to $94.84 billion, better than analyst expectations of a 4.4% decline to $93 billion, according to data from Refinitiv. Profit was flat at $1.52 per share, compared with estimates of a 5.7% fall to $1.43 per share, according to Refinitiv data. Apple shares rose 2% in after-hours trading. A 1.5% rise in Apple&#039;s iPhone revenue contrasted with the broader consumer electronics industry, which is grappling with a decline in sales of smartphones, tablets and PCs as consumers and businesses who scooped up electronics during the pandemic tighten spending amid rising interest rates and economic uncertainty. The company also held its dividend and stock buyback programs roughly in line with its last update to them a year ago, approving $90 billion in additional buybacks. Apple CEO Tim Cook told Reuters in an interview on Thursday that the company set a fiscal second-quarter record for iPhone sales, thanks in part to picking up new users in markets such as India, where Cook recently traveled for the opening of the company&#039;s first retail stores in the country. \"We were thrilled by our performance in emerging markets,\" Cook said. \"We set records for the iPhone installed base in every geographic segment, and we had very strong &#039;new to&#039; (sales in) emerging markets, particularly in Brazil, India and Mexico.\" Cook also said supply-chain snarls have vanished. \"We had no material shortages at all during the quarter across any of the products,\" he said. But not all of Apple&#039;s business lines were immune to the electronics slump, with sales of Macs falling sharply while iPad revenue slipped. Sales in China also dropped 2.9% to $17.8 billion, a slightly larger drop than overall revenue. Other firms in the industry have predicted a rebound in the second half of the year, and Wall Street expects Apple to recover faster and show modest year-over-year revenue growth during its fiscal third quarter ending in June. Apple executives are expected to give a forecast on a conference call with investors later on Thursday. Apple has in recent weeks announced new service businesses such as a high-yield savings account, but investors are still waiting to see the company&#039;s next major hardware product. Bloomberg has reported the iPhone maker could unveil a mixed-reality headset as soon as next month, when it holds its annual software developer conference. IPhone sales rose 1.5% to $51.33 billion, compared with analyst expectations of a 3.3% decline to $48.9 billion, according to Refinitiv. Those results occurred against the backdrop of a 13% decline in global smartphone shipments during the first three months of 2023, during which the research firm Canalys said Apple gained market share against Android rivals. Mac sales fell more than 30% to $7.17 billion compared with analyst estimates of a 25% decline to $7.8 billion, according to Refinitiv. Apple&#039;s sales fared only slightly better than PC unit shipments in the market, which fell 33% in the calendar first quarter, according to Canalys data. Sales in Apple&#039;s wearables business, which includes devices like AirPods and the Apple Watch, fell less than 1% to $8.76 billion, compared with estimates of a 4.4% drop to $8.4 billion. Apple&#039;s biggest growth segment was its services business, which includes products like iCloud and Apple Pay, which grew 5.5% to $20.9 billion, in line with analyst expectations. Cook said Apple now has 975 million subscribers on its platform, which includes both Apple services and third-party apps, up from 935 million last quarter and an increase of 150 million from a year ago. Apple said its board of directors authorized a 24 cents-per- share dividend in addition to share repurchases. Both were roughly the same as the 23 cents-per-share dividend and previous $90 billion share repurchase increase the company announced a year ago.

For the period ending April 1, Apple (AAPL) earned $1.52 per share on $94.84B in revenue, due in part to strength from the iPhone, which rose 1.5% year-over-year to $51.33B.

Berkshire first bought the stock in 2016, and since then Apple has grown to a $110 billion position comprising roughly 40% of Berkshire&#039;s stock holdings. Berkshire owns just under 6% of Apple. The rapid growth has positioned the largest US public company as a fixture in Berkshire Hathaway&#039;s annual shareholder letters and Buffett&#039;s comments during annual meetings. At Berkshire&#039;s annual shareholders meeting on Saturday, investors will eagerly await what Buffett might say about his largest holding and its new forays into, , and The meeting also comes less than 48 hours after Apple&#039;s earnings report published late Thursday, which showed better than expected iPhone sales despite a 3% revenue decline year-over-year. Year-to-date, shares of the iPhone maker are up nearly 30%. The four &#039;jewels&#039; In 2020, Buffett highlighted the Apple investment as one of the company’s four \"jewels,\" along with Berkshire&#039;s insurance operations led by Ajit Jain, Berkshire&#039;s ownership of railroad BNSF, and its Berkshire Hathaway Energy subsidiary. From shareholder returns to its brand recognition to its management team, Apple fits the bill for a Buffett bet. Buffett has long been a believer in the benefits of share buybacks and highlighted outsized dividend payments Berkshire receives from some long-time holdings like Coca-Cola (KO) and American Express (AXP) in this year&#039;s letter to shareholders. \"Our cost for that stake was $36 billion,\" Buffett wrote in his 2020 annual shareholder letter about the company&#039;s investment in Apple. \"Since then, we have both enjoyed regular dividends, averaging about $775 million annually, and have also — in 2020 — pocketed an additional $11 billion by selling a small portion of our position. Story continues \"Despite that sale — voila! — Berkshire now owns 5.4% of Apple. That increase was costless to us, coming about because Apple has continuously repurchased its shares, thereby substantially shrinking the number it now has outstanding.\" Today, Berkshire owns about 5.8% of the company. This content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it. The Oracle of Omaha, however, was patient in entering the fray on his Apple position. Berkshire didn&#039;t place its bets on the company after the success of Apple&#039;s iPod launch in 2001 or its iPhone launch six years later. Instead, Buffett&#039;s ride with Apple has been fueled largely by growth in the company&#039;s services business. In 2015, Apple reported annual services revenue of $19.9 billion and wearable revenue of $10.1 billion. In 2022, those categories produced $78.1 billion and $41.2 billion, respectively. \"I just think of basically the utility of those products to a ecosystem that is demographically terrific and finds that instrument useful dozens and dozens of times a day,\" Buffett told Yahoo Finance in 2020. \"It&#039;s almost indispensable, not only to individuals, business, I mean, everything.\" More recently, Apple launched its high-yield savings account with Goldman Sachs, and at an event in September 2022 the company stressed its ambitions to integrate more deeply with healthcare tools. And when it comes to management, Buffett has rarely been lacking for praise of Apple CEO Tim Cook. \"Tim Cook, Apple’s brilliant CEO, quite properly regards users of Apple products as his first love, but all of his other constituencies benefit from Tim’s managerial touch as well,\" Buffett wrote in Berkshire&#039;s 2021 letter to shareholders. Adding at the 2021 annual shareholders meeting: \"Tim Cook was underappreciated for a while. He&#039;s one of the best managers in the world. And I&#039;ve seen a lot of managers. And he&#039;s got a product that people absolutely love. And there&#039;s an installed base of people, and they get satisfaction rates of 99%.\" Apple CEO Tim Cook arrives for the first in-person annual meeting since 2019 of Berkshire Hathaway Inc in Omaha, Nebraska, U.S. April 30, 2022.

AAPL reported second-quarter results that exceeded expectations Thursday, in line with the positive earnings trend seen so far in the big tech space. The outperformance came as iPhone revenue exceeded expectations and the Services revenue climbed to a new record. Apple&#039;s Key Q2 Numbers: Cupertino, California-based Apple reported earnings per share of $1.52, exceeding the consensus estimate of $1.43 per share.The bottom line was flat with the year-ago period and down 19.2% from the previous quarter&#039;s $1.88 per share.Revenue came in $94.8 billion versus the Street forecast of $92.96 million. This marks a 3% year-over-year decline and 19.1% sequential drop.It should be noted the second quarter is one of Apple&#039;s seasonally slow periods, coming right after the holiday shopping season. Analysts, including Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring and Wedbush&#039;s Daniel Ives, were bracing for in-line March quarter results. “We are pleased to report an all-time record in Services and a March quarter record for iPhone despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, and to have our installed base of active devices reach an all-time high,\" said Tim Cook, Apple&#039;s CEO. The gross margin came in at 44.26% versus 43.75% in the second quarter of 2022 and 42.96% in the first quarter of 2023.Apple’s Shareholder Returns: The company announced a $90-billion incremental buyback authorization and a 4% year-over-year increase in dividends to 24 cents per share.\"Our year-over-year business performance improved compared to the December quarter, and we generated strong operating cash flow of $28.6 billion while returning over $23 billion to shareholders during the quarter,\" said Luca Maestri, Apple&#039;s CFO. See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Apple StockApple’s Business Segments: Among products, iPhone revenue came in at $51.33 billion, ahead of the $50.3 billion Morgan Stanley’s Woodring estimated. The analyst estimated shipments at 54.5 million and ASPs at $922 due to a strong high-end mix. iPhone revenue grew 1.5% year-over-year.Mac revenue slumped over 31% to $7.17 billion. Woodring recently trimmed his Mac shipment forecast from 4.8 million units to 4.3 million units, consequently taking down the product’s revenue estimate by 10% to $6.3 billion.iPad revenue fell 12.8%, while Services revenue rose 5.5% to a record $20.91 billion.Deepwater Asset Management&#039;s Gene Munster said investors are also likely to focus on the active installed base, which rose 8% year-over-year to over 2 billion in the first quarter.\"A growing base means the Apple product flywheel is working,\" he added.Why June Quarter Could Be Soft: Apple could shed light on June quarter performance on the earnings call scheduled for 5 p.m. EDT.Morgan Stanley&#039;s Woodring expects June quarter revenue of $80.3 billion, marking a 3% year-over-year decrease. This is below the consensus estimate of $84.71 billion.The firm&#039;s expectation is premised on 41 million units of iPhone shipments, a $901 ASP and lower Mac, iPad and Services revenue. The variance of June quarter revenue vis-à-vis the consensus is primarily due to the softer iPhone revenue forecast of $37.2 billion.Build strength in April and May could weaken as the trough of the iPhone 14 cycle approaches.Morgan Stanley expects a better-than-consensus gross margin forecast for the quarter due to more favorable forex comparisons and further operational expenditure discipline.AAPL Price Action: Apple shares have gained 27.8% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 Index, which added 5,8% during the same period.Ahead of the quarterly results, Woodring said a March quarter beat and June quarter guide down have not historically produced a negative post-earnings stock reaction. Investors typically look past the trough of the cycle to the upcoming iPhone launch.Munster said Apple&#039;s investment case will likely shift to a consumer staples company that should yield a higher multiple. \"On top of that, Apple is making meaningful progress in AI, a dynamic that is under-appreciated by investors,\" he added.The average analyst price target for Apple stock, according to TipRanks, is $177.23, suggesting a roughly 6% upside from current levels.After closing Thursday’s regular session down nearly a percentage point at $165.79, the stock is up 0.62% in after-hours trading, according to Benzinga Pro data.Read Next: Photo via Shutterstock.\n\n---\n\n[2023-05-05] 2023-05-04 21:01:02\n标题: Big Caps Help Clot the Bleeding, Will Apple's Beat Add a Bandage?\n内容: The major indexes suffered the fourth-straight day of poor action on Thursday, with the financial sector leading to the downside. The market failed to celebrate hints by Fed Chair Jerome Powell that the Fed is likely finished with rate hikes for now after ten-straight increases. The primary focus was on stress in regional banks that are still sitting on hundreds of billions of unrealized losses due to the aggressive interest rate hikes. Over 650 stocks were hitting new 12-month lows, with the majority of them in the financial and real estate investment trust sectors. Out of 143 stocks in the Regional Bank exchange-traded fund (KRE) , seven finished with gains and 136 with losses. There were some pockets of speculative action with names like DataDog (DDOG) , Shake Shack (SHAK) , and Royal Caribbean RCL performing well, but it was big-cap technology stocks such as Microsoft (MSFT) , Amazon (AMZN) , and Tesla (TSLA) that prevented a real bloodbath. What is most notable about market conditions right now is that the Dow Jones and the Russell 2000 are about flat for 2023, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are still holding on to decent gains. Will the big caps pull up the small caps, or will the small caps lead the way down for the broad market? Apple&#039;s (AAPL) earnings were looming, and the good news was that expectations were fairly low, but the bad news is that the stock is relatively extended compared to the broad market. Now Apple earnings are out and ahead on the top and bottom lines. It also is increasing its buyback program. There is an initial spike higher, but we will have to wait for the conference call to clarify guidance. The big question is how much willingness to chase the stock now. It is already starting to reverse a few minutes after the news. Expectations were low, but AAPL is not a cheap stock. The other question is whether AAPL can lift the broader market. It will help indices if it stays strong, but will it help breadth? Have a good evening. I&#039;ll see you tomorrow. Apple, AMZN and MSFT are among the holdings in the Action Alerts PLUS member club .

Cook noted how important India is to the company&#039;s future, noting the number of people expected to move into the middle class in the comping years. \"India is at a tipping point,\" Cook said. The 61-year-old Cook added that the $51.3B in iPhone related revenue was a testament to the strong demand for the iPhone 14 and iPhone Plus models, as well as its Pro and Pro Max models. However, the Mac and iPad - both of which performed inline with company estimates - suffered due to strong demand for M1 Macs, as well as foreign exchange and macro related issues. However, Cook noted that customers have responded to its M2 Macs, specifically calling out the M2 Mac mini. Services strength was led by Apple care and video, though gaming was called out for some weakness, according to CFO Luca Maestri. The company now has more than 975M paid subscriptions across its Services, up 150M year-over-year and nearly double three years ago. Seeking Alpha contributor Bill Maurer called the results a \"solid beat.\" Looking to the June quarter, Maestri said Apple&#039;s (AAPL) results should be similar to the March quarter, with foreign exchange a headwind of roughly 4 percentage points. Services revenue is expected to be similar to the March quarter, with mobile gaming and advertising seeing some weakness. Gross margins are expected to be between 44% and 45%, while operating expenses are forecast to be between $13.6B and $13.8B.

This compares to earnings of $1.52 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5.56%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.93 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.88, delivering a surprise of -2.59%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. Apple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, posted revenues of $94.84 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.63%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $97.28 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock&#039;s immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management&#039;s commentary on the earnings call. Apple shares have added about 28.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500&#039;s gain of 6.5%. What&#039;s Next for Apple? While Apple has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors&#039; minds is: what&#039;s next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company&#039;s earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Story continues Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company&#039;s just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today&#039;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.21 on $84.11 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.01 on $387.99 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

The company delivered an EPS surprise of +5.56%, with the consensus EPS estimate being $1.44. While investors closely watch year-over-year changes in headline numbers -- revenue and earnings -- and how they compare to Wall Street expectations to determine their next course of action, some key metrics always provide a better insight into a company&#039;s underlying performance.

The Dow sheathed another -283 points, -0.85% — making it the second of the major indices to trade in negative territory (behind the small-cap Russell 2000) year to date — while the S&amp;P 500 was -0.71%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq outperformed the field (and still up +15% year to date), down only -0.49%, while the Russell came in worst of all, -1.19%. Further spread of destabilization in West Coast regional banks continues, with PacWest PACW apparently the next domino to fall following First Republic’s collapse earlier this week — or at least that’s what market participants are expressing. PACW has fallen a bracing -50% in today’s session alone, -66% for the past month and -86% year to date. Thus far, the Fed has not treated this regional bank issue as terribly important — if it did, we probably wouldn’t have seen another interest rate hike yesterday. Meanwhile, after today’s close, we see a full parade of consumer-facing quarterly earnings results — and this is the part of the economy continuing to show resiliency. Don’t take my word for it, though. See with your own eyes: The world’s largest gadget maker, Apple Inc. AAPL, recorded beats for both earnings in its fiscal Q2 — $1.52 per share versus $1.44 anticipated — and quarterly sales — $94.84 billion versus $93.32 billion expected. The iPhone alone brought in $51.33 billion for the three months reported, +1.5%, while the Mac and iPad continued to slow down: -31% and -13%, respectively. Services came in more than +5% higher year over year to $20.91 billion, but were still slightly below expectations. Gross Margins of 44.3% were moderately better than the estimated 44.1%, as demand strength continues forward. Apple sees strength in China and especially India, where the company is reportedly expanding production. The company is also instituting a $90 billion share buyback and a dividend increase of 4% to 24 cents per share. Shares have gained +1.4% on the news in the after-market. Expedia EXPE actually missed expectations on both top and bottom lines — negative earnings of -20 cents per share missed the $0.00 expected on $2.67 billion in sales, which was marginally shy of the Zacks consensus $2.69 billion. But the company sees Gross Bookings up +20%, and the company is buying back $600 million in shares, which has helped send EXPE stock +1.5% in late trading. Expedia-competitor Booking.com BKNG shares are on an opposing track: the company beat estimates on both top and bottom lines, but shares are down in the after-market: earnings of $11.16 per share were above the $10.62 expected, on $3.78 billion which took out the $3.74 billion consensus. Gross Travel Bookings continued their strong trajectory from Q4, +44% year over year. But shares are giving back around -3% of the +28% growth in the stock, year to date. DoorDash DASH shares have been ping-ponging on the news of its Q1 report, posting a better-than-expected loss of -41 cents per share from the -56 projected, on $2.04 billion in revenues which outpaced the $1.92 billion expected, +40% year over year. Gross Order Volume grew +29% year over year, with Total Orders +27% — another company holding onto its strength from the previous quarter. Shares have moved from -7% after the release to +4% at this hour. Lyft LYFT is not so lucky at this hour — even on both top- and bottom-line beats in Q1: a positive +$0.07 per share versus an expected -$0.09 on $1.00 billion in sales which surpassed the $976.9 million anticipated, shares are tumbling -13% in late trading. Revenue guidance for Q2 is lighter than initial expected in our Zacks consensus, with adjusted EBITDA guidance notably lower than previously thought. Coinbase COIN is seeing a big pop in the after-market: +6% on much-better-than-expected results in Q1: a loss per share of -34 cents is much better than the forecast -$1.44, and $773 million in quarterly revenues easily outpaced the $652.8 million consensus. Cost-cutting and a jump in subscriber revenue assisted Coinbase’s healthy quarter, although the company projects lower subscriber growth for the ongoing quarter. Finally, Block SQ — cash payment platform and parent of Cash App, formerly known as Square Inc. — decisively outperformed expectations on both top and bottom lines after today’s close: earnings of 40 cents per share bettered the 31 cents predicted, while revenues of $4.99 billion swept past the $4.58 billion analysts were looking for. Full-year guidance is also improved, as customer engagement remains strong. Shares are +3.5% in late trading at this hour. Questions or comments about this article and/or its author?

AAPL reported forecast-beating results for the fiscal year second quarter, thanks to stronger-than-expected iPhone sales and record Services segment revenue.Following the earnings release, CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri delved into the results and outlook and fielded analysts&#039; questions on the earnings call.Here are the key takeaways:Emerging Market Shines: Performance in emerging markets from South Asia to India to Latin America to the Middle East was strong, Maestri said on the call. The \"rest of the Asia-Pacific\" region saw 15.3% year-over-year revenue growth, outperforming the rest of the geographies.Worldwide iPhone revenue rose 2% year-over-year to $51.3 billion, a March quarter record, due to March quarter record performance in several developed and emerging markets such as India, Indonesia, Turkey and the UAE.Despite the currency headwinds, the quarter was a great one for emerging markets, CEO Cook said. \"We’re putting efforts in a number of these markets and really see, particularly given our low share and the dynamics of the demographics etc., a great opportunity for us and in those markets,\" he added. India At Tipping Point: While noting that India saw double-digit year-over-year growth, Cook said the country is an incredibly exciting market. \"There are a lot of people coming into the middle class and I really feel that India is at a tipping point,\" he said.See Also: Best Technology Stocks Right NowForex Remains A Headwind: The March quarter saw a 500-basis-point forex headwind, Cook said. This along with macroeconomic challenges led to the 3% year-over-year revenue drop. On a constant currency basis, revenue was higher year-over-year.Record Installed Base: Installed base of active devices grew to a new record, thanks to a higher level of customer satisfaction and loyalty.Mac, iPad Softness – Function Of Tough Comps: Cook said Mac and iPad revenues were in line with expectations. The year-over-year drop for both categories was due to a tough comparison with a year ago, which saw Apple roll out M1 chips throughout the Mac lineup and M1-powered iPad Air. iPad revenue also took a hit from forex headwinds and macroeconomic challenges.Services – Crowning Glory: Services revenue came in at an all-time high of $20.9 billion, with record performances across App Store, Apple Music, iCloud and payment services. The business has now more than 975 million paid subscriptions, up 150 million over the past year. The company noted record Services revenue in the Greater China region that comprises mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. The rest of the geographies saw a March quarter record.Services Boost Gross Margin: The 130 basis-point gross margin expansion from the previous quarter was due to a favorable mix shift towards services partially offset by leverage. The product gross margin fell 30 basis points sequentially to 36.7%, while the Services margin rose 20 basis points to 71%.Macro Hurts Wearables, Home &amp; Accessories: Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $8.8 billion, down 1% year over year, with the macroeconomic environment serving as a drag. The U.S. and Greater China, however, saw record March performance for the segment. The Apple Watch installed base set a new all-time record.June quarter Outlook: Maestri guided year-over-year June quarter revenue performance to be similar to that of the March quarter. This translates to revenue of $80.51 billion, below the consensus estimate of $84.71 billion. The company expects nearly 400 basis points of negative forex impact for the June quarter.The company expects the Services business to see the same growth as in the March quarter.Gross margin is expected at 44-44.5%.AI Focus: On AI, Cook said it is very important to be deliberate and thoughtful in how one approaches these things and that there are a number of issues that need to be sorted.The Apple CEO, however, conceded that the potential is certainly very interesting. The company has made enormous progress integrating AI machine learning throughout its ecosystem, weaving it into products and features for many years, he said.\"We view AI as huge and you know we’ll continue weaving it in our products on a very thoughtful basis,\" he added.Green Initiatives: Apple&#039;s manufacturing partners support over 13 gigawatts of renewable energy, translating to 17.4 million metric tons of avoided carbon emissions, equivalent to removing nearly 3.8 million cars from the road. The company is investing an additional $200 million in restore fund meant to support scalable nature-based carbon removal projects.Price Action: In after-hours trading on Thursday, Apple stock rose 2.18% to $169.40, according to Benzinga Pro data.Read Next:\n\n---\n\n[2023-05-05] 2023-05-05 01:20:45\n标题: Apple, Carvana, Coinbase, DraftKings, Block: Why These 5 Stocks Are Drawing Investors' Attention Today\n内容: U.S. markets ended in the red on Thursday as concerns regarding the banking sector gained momentum following PacWest Bancorp&#039;s PACW move to explore strategic options.

The upgrade activity likely was strong in the quarter and overall ASPs may have been above $900, he added.The analyst noted that iPad revenue fell 13% year-over-year to $6.67 billion, a tad below the consensus of $6.69 billion, and Mac revenue plunged 31% to $7.17 billion versus consensus of $7.80 billion.Wearables revenue came in at $8.76 billion above the Street&#039;s estimate of $8.43 billion, he said.

GOOG GOOGL, Tim Cook says Apple Inc. AAPL will tread thoughtfully. What Happened: On Thursday, Apple reported forecast-beating results for the fiscal year’s second quarter, during which Cook only mentioned AI in one answer, that too in a relatively vague manner. This is startling in comparison, considering Meta Platforms Inc. META, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, who seem to be all making aggressive headways in the segment.See Also: Apple Q2 Earnings Thump Estimates, Buoyed By Robust iPhone Sales, Record Services Revenue“It’s very important to be deliberate and thoughtful on how you approach these things,” Cook said on the earnings call.Cook acknowledged that in the AI field, several issues need to be addressed and sorted, but said that the potential is “certainly very interesting.” He touted features such as “fall detection” on select Apple Watch models and “crash detection” on specific devices to showcase the company’s current utilization of AI. “These things are not only great features, they’re saving people’s lives out there,” Cook stated, adding, “We view AI as huge and we’ll continue weaving it in our products on a very thoughtful basis.”Why It’s Important: Microsoft and Google have made significant progress in utilizing AI, with chatbots such as OpenAI’s chatGPT, Bard, and Bing AI dominating the current landscape. In contrast, Apple and Cook’s approach to AI appears to be more cautious.Last month, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said that despite Cupertino’s not-so-proactive approach, it could be the “one to benefit no matter where the industry goes.”Ives also said that Apple has invested in generative AI but did not reveal any current status or location details. This aligns with the company’s tendency to maintain a high level of secrecy around its research and product development.Check out more of Benzinga’s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.Read Next:\n\n---\n\n[2023-05-05] 2023-05-05 05:50:00\n标题: Apple stakes future growth on emerging markets, starting with India\n内容: By Stephen Nellis May 5 (Reuters) - When Apple Inc AAPL.O surprised investors this week with a rise in iPhone sales despite a slump in the global smartphone market, Chief Executive Tim Cook credited emerging markets like India where the company is luring away Android phone users. Cook is betting that those markets will provide more opportunities for growth, with their youthful populations and relatively few iPhones. Apple said iPhone sales rose 1.5% to $51.3 billion for its fiscal second quarter even as global smartphone shipments fell 13% in January to March, according to research firm Canalys, whose data showed Apple gained market share from Android phones. Apple said it set sales records in several countries across South Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. \"We&#039;re putting efforts in a number of these markets and really see, particularly given our low share and the dynamics of the demographics, a great opportunity for us in those markets,\" Cook told investors during a conference call. India is perhaps Apple&#039;s biggest focus. The company recently opened its first two retail stores there, in Mumbai and Delhi, and while Apple does not disclose revenue for the country, Cook told investors that it set a quarterly record and percentage growth was in very strong double digits year-over-year. \"There are a lot of people coming into the middle class, and I really feel that India is at a tipping point, and it&#039;s great to be there,\" Cook said on the conference call. Apple was the second biggest revenue generating brand in India in 2022, second only to Samsung as it gained 18% of the total value of smartphone shipments, according to research firm Counterpoint. For Apple, selling an iPhone in an emerging market represents more than just the sale of one device - it represents the chance to get consumers hooked on Apple devices and services over time. Customers who start with an iPhone might later add an Apple Watch or AirPods or sign up for subscription services. Cook said he saw opportunities for Apple in India in services but said that average revenue per user - a metric known as ARPU in the subscription business - would take time to catch up to Apple&#039;s other markets. USED IPHONE BOOM Part of the reason that Apple has been able to gain market share in both emerging and developed markets is the emergence of a booming market for used iPhones. Sales of refurbished iPhones rose 16% in volume globally during 2022. India led the growth with a 19% jump, according to Counterpoint, with iPhones accounting for 11% of secondary smartphone sales in India. In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, Apple&#039;s Cook said little of Apple&#039;s direct iPhone revenue comes from refurbished devices. However he said the company has tried to bolster the used iPhone market by offering trade-in deals on its iPhones and building them sturdy enough to last several owners. \"We encourage the market and it provides us an opportunity to hit some price points that we would not otherwise play in,\" Cook said in the interview.

After declining 8% in the December quarter due to production disruptions in China, iPhone revenue increased 1.5% year-over-year to $51.3 billion in the March quarter. iPhone Sales Rebound in March Quarter It’s worth noting that iPhone sales increased in the March quarter despite a 15% decline in global smartphone shipments, as per IDC estimates. During the Q2 earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook said, “The iPhone 14 and 14 plus continue to delight users with their long lasting battery and advanced camera.” Further, CFO Luca Maestri highlighted that the latest survey of U.S. consumers by 451 Research revealed 99% customer satisfaction for the iPhone 14 family. Additionally, iPhone’s active installed base rose to a “new all-time high,” with growth experienced across all geographic segments. The company boasts an iPhone base of “well over” $1 billion active devices, reflecting customer satisfaction and growing loyalty. In particular, iPhone witnessed solid demand in several developed and emerging markets in South Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. March quarter iPhone sales doubled on a year-over-year basis in India, Indonesia, Turkey, and the UAE. CEO Cook opened two retail stores in India in April and said that the company intends to expand its operations in the country. Cook stated that he was delighted to see the enthusiasm for the Apple brand in India. “There are a lot of people coming into the middle class, and I really feel that India is at a tipping point, and it’s great to be there,” he added. While iPhone sales improved and surpassed analysts’ estimate of $48.8 billion in the fiscal second quarter, the company’s overall sales declined 2.5% to $94.8 billion due to lower iPad and Mac sales amid macro challenges and currency headwinds. Is Apple a Good Stock to Buy? Following the results on Thursday, Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng reiterated a Buy rating on AAPL stock and raised the price target to $209 from $200. The analyst believes that given Apple’s low iPhone market share in developing markets (for instance, 3% in India and less than 1% in Indonesia), the company’s success in these markets could drive its revenue and installed base growth in the years ahead. The analyst is also upbeat about Apple’s Services business and sees it as a “reliable source” of long-term growth.

Foxconn said revenue last month reached T$429.2 billion ($14 billion), in line with the company&#039;s own expectations. For smart consumer electronics products, which include smartphones and are the company&#039;s main business driver, revenue in April declined as it entered the \"traditional slow season\", the company said in a statement, without elaborating. Business in the second quarter is expected to decline due to a high base last year and \"the seasonal off-peak period\" amid a transition between old and new products, it said. The first half of the year is traditionally slower for Taiwan tech manufacturers as major electronics vendors including Apple AAPL.O launch new products near the year-end holiday season. Apple results for the quarter ended April 1 beat expectations on Thursday, thanks to better-than-expected iPhone sales and inroads in India and other newer markets. Foxconn will report first quarter earnings on May 11 when it will also give an update on its outlook for the full year. The company in March predicted revenue for the full year to be flat, with weak demand for consumer electronics offset by growth in computing, cloud, networking and component products. Foxconn shares have risen 5.1% so far this year, lagging the broader Taiwan market .TWII, which is up 10.5%.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index .STOXX edged up 0.1%, but is on track for its second consecutive weekly loss. Energy .SXEP and utilities shares .SXPP led the gains on the index, rising 1.4% and 1.0% respectively, while food and beverage shares .SX3P slid 0.4%. Air France-KLM SA AIRF.PA lost 2.8% despite better-than-expected first-quarter revenue and robust cash flow as it benefited from a global recovery in air travel. The ECB raised its benchmark rates by 25 basis points to 3.25%, the smallest increase in its rate-hike cycle that started last summer, but signalled more tightening was to come. French ECB policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau said earlier in the day that the ECB will continue increasing interest rates until inflation is under control. \"Inflation pressures worldwide help in driving equity markets although we don&#039;t like to pay higher prices, as consumers it eats into our pockets. The higher prices go to some company reaping the rewards of those higher prices,\" said Chi Chan, Portfolio Manager and Senior Research Analyst, Federated Hermes. \"As long as you&#039;re a company that is able to pass through inflation or higher, then you&#039;re a beneficiary and we do see that in the latest earnings.\" ECB&#039;s Survey of Professional Forecasters showed on Friday that euro zone inflation could be lower in the coming years than previously expected but may stay above ECB&#039;s 2% target further out. Among stocks, the biggest gainer on the index, Adidas AG ADSGn.DE climbed 7.1% after reporting better-than-expected first-quarter results, with investors hoping the German sportswear giant can turn its fortunes around. Caixabank SA CABK.MC rose 1.2% after the Spanish lender reported first quarter net profit above expectations and raised its 2023 lending income guidance. Meanwhile, shares of Evotec SE EVTG.DE lost the most on the index, dropping 9.0% after the company announced that it will leave German index MDAX .MDAXI. In the U.S., Apple Inc AAPL.O, the world&#039;s largest company by market capitalisation, surprised investors with a rise in iPhone sales even as the global smartphone market slumps. Investors will keep a close eye on the euro zone&#039;s retail sales data due at 0900 GMT to assess the economic strength of the region.

But India’s richest man is looking to play disruptor once again on his home turf with a VR headset that costs just under $16. What Happened: Reliance Industries, owned and led by India&#039;s richest man Mukesh Ambani, this week launched its first-ever virtual reality (VR) headset called JioDive under its subsidiary Reliance Jio.Jio’s affordable VR headset poses a significant threat to established global players such as Meta, whose upcoming Quest Pro is expected to cost $999, and Apple’s VR headset, which is rumored to be priced as high as $3,000.See Also: JioCinema New Destination For HBO Shows?

Apple (AAPL) reported better-than-expected revenues and earnings and provided positive guidance. That isn&#039;t too surprising as it typically does a very nice job of managing expectations, and the stock is trading up a bit more than 2%. Apple enjoys a unique position in the market. It is the largest market capitalization at around $2.6 trillion and impacts cap-weighted indexes more than any other stock. It is often viewed as a safe place to park funds, although it is not at all cheap. Apple trades with a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 28, but earnings per share this quarter were flat and revenue fell by about 3%. We will see how well Apple holds up as the day progresses. It is a good measure of overall market sentiment, and if it starts to lose support it will be a signal that the market mood is shifting and concern is growing about the economy. Regional banks are seeing a rebound this morning. There has been talk that many names have been manipulated lower by aggressive shorting, but there obviously are substantial issues in the sector, where there may be at least $500 billion in unrealized losses due to the sharp increase in interest rates over the past year. I expect to see bargain hunters sift through the wreckage for names that have been unfairly included in the sector selloff, but there is real liquidation taking place and a rebound may take time. At 8.30 am ET, the April jobs news will be reported. It is expected that nonfarm payrolls will drop to around 180,000 from 236,000 in March and that the unemployment rate will tick higher to 3.6% from 3.5%. What is most important about this report is the response will indicate the degree to which market concerns shift from inflation to economic growth. We will see if a soft report is good news because it is disinflationary or if it is bad news because it is recessionary. After the Fed interest rate decision this past week, the market is data-depended because the Fed said that it is data-dependent. The general view is that the Fed is done hiking rights for the year, but the big question is how fast the economy is cooling and whether it will force the Fed to cut rates later this year. Technically speaking, stocks are a bit oversold here and ready for relief, but charts are under pressure. The Russell 2000 looks particularly vulnerable as it hovers near the year&#039;s lows and looks poised to retest the bear market lows. Breadth continues to be quite poor and there was an expansion in new 12-month lows to more than 650 names on Thursday. This was largely due to weakness in the financial and banking sector, but that doesn&#039;t help matters. We&#039;ll see what the market reaction is to jobs news before the open, and then we will see how well Apple can hold on to its gains. (AAPL is a holding of Action Alerts PLUS.

Revenue during the month was the equivalent of $14B, and in line with Foxconn&#039;s () own expectations, as smart consumer electronics products had double-digit growth and computing products showed \"significant\" growth on a month-over-month basis. The company added that cloud and networking products performance was flattish, while components and other products declined slightly month-over-month. Despite the rebound from March, Foxconn said April revenue was down almost 12% from a year ago, as all revenue from all four product lines fell, and smart consumer electronics entering a \"traditional slow season.\" Foxconn () is Apple&#039;s (NASDAQ:AAPL) largest manufacturing partner and produces devices such as iPhones, iPads and more for the U.S. tech giant. Cupertino, California-based Apple (AAPL) reported second-quarter results on Thursday that were deemed impressive, but Wall Street was mixed on the company&#039;s forecast. Foxconn () maintained its outlook for its second quarter, and said it expects sales to decline on both a sequential and year-over-year basis due to \"the seasonal off-peak period as new and old products transition\" and \"unseasonally strong pull-in in the first half of last year.\" Taiwan-based Foxconn is slated to have a conference call to discuss its own quarterly results on May 11.

Every firm on and off Wall Street has an analyst dedicated to Apple. They are poring through Thursday&#039;s earnings report twice over. I think they need to find the good in the report and push it down investors&#039; throats because Apple is one of the few pieces of the market foundation that&#039;s offering hope. Headlines likely will focus on a net income beat, or earnings-per-share beat. Some may want to talk about record iPhone sales, which, admittedly, is impressive, especially after the recent Qualcomm (QCOM) report. I&#039;m struggling with the fact that quarterly revenue was down 3% year over year and EPS would have been down as well had it not been for the insane amount of stock repurchased over the past year. Apple bought back $90 billion of its stock last quarter alone. Management did set revenue expectations for the current quarter well above current market estimates, so that should be seen as a positive. Did Apple do enough to save the market? I don&#039;t think so, but it looks like it did enough to save itself Apple likely will be our guide. If the stock goes green to red, using last night&#039;s after-hours action as the green, then the only position I&#039;d consider into the afternoon or even over the weekend is some limited short exposure or put action on pretty much the index of your choice. I likely would look at a mix of the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) and the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) or possibly use the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) rather than the SPY. My inkling would be to use the SPY if it is under the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA). It closed right on the 50-day EMA yesterday. A break could send us down to the 200-day EMA, currently around $399, before we find any stability. Any close under the 200-day EMA for the SPY could get ugly. Bad things happen under the 200-day moving average. I&#039;m not calling for a crash, but it&#039;s fair to say crashes don&#039;t happen from a position of strength; they occur in weakness. Trading below the 50-day and 200-day EMA is a position of weakness. If Apple can close the week strong, it should carry the QQQ back above short-term EMAs. While I&#039;m not looking long for a quick flip, if I move in that direction, my eyes will be focused on QQQ or AAPL itself. The relatively strong price action is too important to ignore. This still isn&#039;t a market to buy weakness or call bottoms, so if you want to be long, keep a focus on these or stocks reacting well to their own earnings report.\n\n---\n\n[2023-05-05] 2023-05-05 12:41:39\n标题: Booking Holdings To Rally Around 18%?

Nayyar agreed, saying AI could also be used as a tool to help patients stick to their medications. She explained, drawing again on the self-driving car example.</p> <p>\"It doesn&#039;t necessarily have to drive the car for you, but can it get you in the right car and tell you to wear your seatbelt,\" Nayyar said. \"There are many different things that AI can do to help complement that patient journey,\"</p> <p>AI also has potential to help the drug industry be more efficient in its research and development. Moderna (MRNA), for example, used AWS (AMZN) to help identify which vaccine formula to pursue in its efforts to protect against COVID-19.</p> <p>\"Moderna was able to reach (development) milestones so quickly due to the programmable nature of mRNA,\" said Dave Johnson, vice president of informatics, data, science and AI at Moderna.</p> <p>And the biotech giant just announced a new partnership with IBM (IBM) to further explore the use of AI in medicine.</p>  <div> <div> <div> <p id=\"p_c02273424dd10144809dd925bac1c188\" class=\"img_p\" ><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dsm9oSjblq0TyHwKpiO9fw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/93df1d00-e5fe-11ed-afcf-58a6e480807b\" id=\"c02273424dd10144809dd925bac1c188\" onerror=\"javascript: this.parentNode.style.display='none'; \" /></p><p></p>  <p id=\"p_c02273424dd10144809dd925bac1c188\" class=\"img_p\" ><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dsm9oSjblq0TyHwKpiO9fw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/93df1d00-e5fe-11ed-afcf-58a6e480807b\" id=\"c02273424dd10144809dd925bac1c188\" onerror=\"javascript: this.parentNode.style.display='none'; \" /></p><p></p>  </div> </div> </div> <div>  A vial of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is displayed on a counter at a pharmacy in Portland, Ore., on, Dec. 27, 2021. (AP Photo/Jenny Kane, File)  </div>  <p>Bill Gates also recently touted AI&#039;s capacity not only to help drug companies, but the potential this technology holds for public health in developing countries.</p> <p>\"There is already software that can look at this data, infer what the pathways are, search for targets on pathogens, and design drugs accordingly.\" the Microsoft (MSFT) founder said in a recent letter. Gates said the next generation of AI tools would be much more efficient, \"and they’ll be able to predict side effects and figure out dosing levels.\"</p> <p>Some experts are hoping AI can help with paperwork as well, a significant burden for clinicians in the era of electronic medical records and claims, as well as on the insurer side in deciding about coverage of claims.</p> Bad data can &#039;jeopardize progress&#039; <p>Experts are also concerned about AI&#039;s potential to produce results based on skewed data the machines learn from, a known risk with machine learning models in healthcare.</p> <p>Addressing these problems would also help ease concerns of clinicians, the GAO&#039;s report noted. And a familiar pathway — robust clinical trials — could be a solution.</p> <p>\"While there is excitement and demonstrated benefits to bringing (AI) tools into clinical practice, poor data quality and prevalent biases in health care can jeopardize progress towards achieving health equity and fuel ongoing uncertainties and hesitancies about adopting these tools,\" the report stated.</p> <p>That&#039;s partly why the recent debate has focused on moving ahead too quickly with the technology, as highlighted in a recent letter signed by Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, among others. It doesn&#039;t call for a pause on AI development in general, but \"merely a stepping back from the dangerous race to ever-larger unpredictable black-box models with emergent capabilities\" for at least six months. \"If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium,\" the letter stated.</p>  <div> <div> <div> <p id=\"p_9080d5652bdd84b4aea15f9c535e49c5\" class=\"img_p\" ><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wTNNdn5C8MjJSiLqcueFwg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/d721f180-b86f-11ed-bf3f-20ec05b52824\" id=\"9080d5652bdd84b4aea15f9c535e49c5\" onerror=\"javascript: this.parentNode.style.display='none'; \" /></p><p></p>  <p id=\"p_9080d5652bdd84b4aea15f9c535e49c5\" class=\"img_p\" ><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wTNNdn5C8MjJSiLqcueFwg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/d721f180-b86f-11ed-bf3f-20ec05b52824\" id=\"9080d5652bdd84b4aea15f9c535e49c5\" onerror=\"javascript: this.parentNode.style.display='none'; \" /></p><p></p>  </div> </div> </div> <div>  The logo of OpenAI is displayed near a response by its AI chatbot ChatGPT on its website, in this illustration picture taken February 9, 2023.

Which is easier in the health world, thanks to the amount of regulation already in place. That makes it more likely that responsible use of AI will be top of mind, which means knowing how the models are behaving over time, how to measure outcomes, and ensuring that \"there is a human in the loop that&#039;s evaluating, correcting, editing,\" Kass-Hout added.</p> <p>And the data have to get to a point of being robust, or multi-modal. That includes storing a person&#039;s medical notes, texts, medical images, records, and lab results all in one place to help with analysis and diagnosis.</p> <p>All of which, in Kass-Hout&#039;s view, means it will take time for this technology to have a large impact on the health care sector. \"These models have never been trained on these kinds of data.\"</p> <p>Follow Anjalee on</p> <p></p> <p></p></p>"

        "content": "<p><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div> <p>After a good week for the bulls, the market is facing some of the most significant news catalysts of the year.</p> <div></div> <p>Most important is the Fed interest rate decision on Wednesday afternoon at 2 p.m. ET. A 0.25% hike is near certain, with Fed Funds futures indicating an 87% likelihood -- but it is the policy statement that will be the primary focus.</p> <div></div> <p>The big question will be whether or not the Fed indicates it is ready to halt rate hikes and wait to see if the lag effect of its policy is working. The market currently sees a 28% chance of another quarter-point hike on June 14. Just one month ago, the odds were zero, however, there are some signs that inflation is holding up in various areas and that the Fed is still concerned.</p> <div></div> <p>Despite the uncertainty about what the Fed will do, the market has been optimistic about the economy. Good reports from Microsoft (MSFT) , Meta (META) , Alphabet (GOOGL) , and others have helped to push the senior indexes higher and created positive sentiment.</p> <div></div> <p>Nevertheless, the bears have been focused on the narrowness of the market. A relatively small number of big-cap names have been driving the action, and these stocks may not be reflective of the issues that are facing the overall economy. Microsoft, for example, is benefiting from the boom in Artificial Intelligence, and that has little to do with current economic conditions.</p> <div></div> <p>This week there will be hundreds more earnings reports to digest, but the \"Big Kahuna,\" Apple (AAPL) , will be the star of the show. Apple reports on Thursday night and is likely to be more impacted by the economy than some of the other large-cap technology names that have reported.</p> <div></div> <p>There is an intense battle taking place between the economic bears convinced that the lag effect of Fed rate hikes will hit hard and the price-action bulls focused on the narrow strength in the indexes and confident that the economy is strong enough to avoid a painful recession.</p> <div></div> <p>What is most important this week isn&#039;t the actual news but the market reaction to that news. The market has been fighting the hawkish Fed for a while, and that will come into focus with the policy meeting this week. There have been some good responses to earnings, and that has likely increased the hope of a positive reaction to Apple.</p> <div></div> <p>I am starting the week with high levels of cash and little interest in doing any major buying right now. Most of the smaller stocks I favor are not exhibiting relative strength or good technical setups, and I&#039;m going to stay patient until that changes. Hopefully, the news this week will shake things up.</p> <div></div> <p>(MSFT, GOOGL and AAPL are holdings in the Action Alerts PLUS member club.

JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co&#039;s shares rose 3.7% in premarket trading after the deal was announced early on Monday, while First Republic&#039;s stock slumped almost 46% to $1.9 before trading in it was suspended. Shares of First Republic&#039;s regional peers PNC Financial PNC.N and Citizens Financial CFG.N slipped 2.3% and 1.4%, respectively, while other big banks including Bank of America BAC.N edged higher. The rescue comes less than two months after a deposit flight from U.S. lenders Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank forced the Fed to step in with emergency measures to stabilize markets. First Republic&#039;s woes kicked off last week on a bleak note, but upbeat earnings from Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Meta Platforms Inc META.O helped the benchmark S&amp;P 500 .SPX notch its second consecutive month of gain on Friday. Analysts now expect first-quarter earnings for S&amp;P 500 companies to fall 1.9% from a year earlier, compared with a 5.1% fall expected at the start of April, according to Refinitiv data. Apple Inc AAPL.Ois set to report later this week. Investors will also focus on Jerome Powell&#039;s press conference to assess if the Fed&#039;s commentary pushes back market expectations of rate cuts before the year-end amid the recent banking turmoil and threats of an imminent recession. \"While the market has priced in another hike this week, we think the developments over the weekend will cause the FOMC to be more prudent with their guidance and respect the message of the market,\" said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member at Great Hill Capital. \"We would not be surprised to see a \"pause\" after this final hike. Markets should take today&#039;s news in stride knowing that the repeated bank failures should now have the Fed back on its heels and defanged moving forward.\" At 7:50 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were down 14 points, or 0.04%, S&amp;P 500 e-minis EScv1 were down 3.75 points, or 0.09%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were down 13.5 points, or 0.1%. Manufacturing data from the Institute for Supply Management and S&amp;P Global for April and the Commerce Department&#039;s construction spending for March will be released later in the day, offering investors more clues on the state of the economy. Among earnings-driven moves, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings NCLH.Nrose 2.7% after the cruise operator raised its full-year profit forecast, betting on higher pricing and pent-up demand from wealthy customers. ON Semiconductor Corp ON.O, MGM Resorts International MGM.N and Franklin Resources Inc BEN.N are some of the major companies reporting quarterly results before the opening bell.

        "title": "US judge declares mistrial in Apple-Masimo smartwatch trade secrets fight",
        "content": "<p>By Blake Brittain May 1 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge in California on Monday declared a mistrial in Masimo Corp&#039;s MASI.O potential billion-dollar smartwatch trade secret lawsuit against Apple Inc AAPL.O after jurors failed to reach a unanimous verdict, multiple media outlets reported. The jury in federal court in Santa Ana could not determine whether Cupertino, California-based Apple misused confidential information from Masimo related to the use of light to measure biomarkers including heart rates and blood-oxygen levels, U.S. District Judge James Selna said. The jury began deliberating on April 26 after a trial lasting about three weeks. Apple said in a statement that it \"deeply respects intellectual property and innovation and does not take or use confidential information from other companies,\" and will ask the court to dismiss remaining claims in the case. A Masimo spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Irvine, California-based Masimo and its spinoff Cercacor Laboratories Inc sued Apple in 2020, accusing it of stealing trade secrets and using them to create and sell several Apple Watch models. The lawsuit claimed Masimo representatives met with Apple in 2013 about integrating its inventions into Apple products and that Apple subsequently hired away two executives - one from Masimo and one from Cercacor - and used their knowledge to copy the technology. Masimo asked for more than $1.8 billion in damages, reduced from its initial request for $3.1 billion after the judge dismissed some of its trade-secret claims during trial. Apple in a court filing called Masimo&#039;s lawsuit a \"maneuver to clear a path\" for its own smartwatch. Apple sued Masimo in Delaware last year, accusing it of patent infringement. Smartwatches, mobile devices worn on the wrist with an array of capabilities, are a lucrative market, with global sales worth tens of billions of dollars. Masimo has also sued Apple at the U.S. International Trade Commission over Apple Watch imports that it said violated its patent rights. An ITC judge preliminarily ruled in favor of Masimo in January, which could lead to an import ban on infringing Apple Watches if the full commission affirms the decision. Apple is facing another potential Apple Watch import ban in a separate patent fight with Mountain View, California-based medical device maker AliveCor Inc over heart-monitoring technology.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Apple, FedEx, Marathon Petroleum and Stellantis",
        "content": "<p>For Immediate Release Chicago, IL – May 2, 2023 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL, FedEx FDX, Marathon Petroleum MPC and Stellantis STLA. Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog: Is This the &#039;Terminal&#039; Fed Hike? Global Week Ahead In the Global Week Ahead, regular monetary policy meetings held by: The U.S. Fed The European Central Bank (ECB), and Australia&#039;s central bank (the RBA) top the agenda The mega-cap tech company Apple Inc. brings the U.S. Q1 earnings season mostly to an end. All of this happens as financial markets work through fresh regional banking tremors, brought on by First Republic Bank in San Francisco, CA. Next are Reuters’ five world market themes, reordered for equity traders— (1) On Wednesday, One More 25bps Policy Rate Hike from the FOMC? The Fed is expected to deliver another 25-basis point interest rate increase on Wednesday and signal a pause in its most aggressive rate-hiking cycle since the 1980s. Policymakers and markets remain at odds over the rates trajectory: The world&#039;s top central bank projects borrowing costs to remain at around current levels through 2023, investors are betting on cuts after the summer. Signs the Fed may be coming around to the market’s view could push Treasury yields lower - in theory benefiting the big mega-cap stocks that led markets higher this year. Futures markets show investors pricing a nearly 90% chance of a rate increase. But confidence in a 25-basis point rate hike has wavered in recent days after problems at lender First Republic (FRC) reignited concerns over the U.S. banking sector. (2) On Thursday, Mega-cap Apple Reports Q1 Earnings The U.S. corporate earnings season reaches a crescendo on Thursday with results from Apple, the largest U.S. company by market value, at $2.6 trillion. Along with other mega-cap stocks, Apple has led the S&amp;P 500&#039;s rally in 2023, giving the company even more heft in indexes. Apple&#039;s over-7% weight in the S&amp;P500 is bigger than the entire energy sector and nearly matches the consumer staples group. The iPhone maker is expected to post $93 billion in revenue for its fiscal second quarter - a 4.4% drop year-on-year, Refinitiv data shows. Analysts expect a nearly -6% drop in earnings per share to $1.43. The report from Apple, whose widely used products and services include MacBooks and iPads but also banking, is a gauge for global consumer demand, and its results stand to ripple through markets given its importance to a number of industries. (3) On Thursday, European Central Bank (ECB) Follows FOMC with Policy Rate Hike The ECB will likely lift rates for a seventh straight time on May 4th and policymakers appear to be converging on a 25-basis point hike rather than a larger 50-bp increase. Yet key inflation and bank lending data releases in the days ahead could sway that outcome. With some stability returning to the banking sector after the March rout, hawks may feel confident pushing for a large hike. Tuesday&#039;s flash April inflation data is likely to confirm underlying price pressures — running above 5% — remains uncomfortably high. Some 2.5 million employees in Germany&#039;s public sector will get a 5.5% permanent increase next year, a sign that wage pressures are picking up. But if bank lending data, also out Tuesday, shows credit conditions have tightened substantially, doves could feel emboldened to push back. (4) On Tuesday, Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Offers Policy Settings Bets for a return to policy tightening by the Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday have fizzled out, after a soft reading of consumer prices added to evidence that inflation peaked at the end of last year. That has put the Aussie dollar under pressure, keeping it pinned near the closely watched $0.66-mark, even when the greenback wilted against other major peers. RBA governor Philip Lowe has stressed a pause at the April meeting did not necessarily mean the tightening cycle is over, and minutes showed a hike was hotly debated. Whether Lowe, whose term ends in September, will be around to oversee further moves is another question. Speculation is rife that, unlike his two predecessors, he won&#039;t be asked to stay on. (5) U.K. Macro Data Updates on Struggling Economy The U.K.&#039;s 1970s-style inflation and near-zero growth isn&#039;t a good look. There isn&#039;t a credit crunch — yet — according to a recent Bank of England survey. But lenders expect rising defaults on consumer credit, mortgages and corporate loans. Data on Tuesday will show whether house prices are indeed moderating, and if the decline in mortgage lending is stabilizing. New car sales, which in March hit 18-month highs, will also be under scrutiny. Brits loaded up on credit card debt at the fastest pace in a 24-month period since early 2006 in February and data from the BoE on Thursday will show how that trend is evolving. This kind of borrowing isn&#039;t cheap. BoE stats show the average interest rate on a UK credit card is 22.5% — its highest since the mid-1990&#039;s. And with more rate rises in the pipeline, the pressure is only likely to intensify. Meanwhile Prime Minister Rishi Sunak faces his first big electoral test on May 4 in local polls where the opposition Labor Party hopes to capitalize on a year of chaos for the governing Conservatives.

        "title": "2 Good Reasons to Buy Apple Stock, and 1 Major Risk to Consider",
        "content": "<p>Few companies have created more wealth for their long-term investors than Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). The iPhone maker is one of the most profitable businesses in history, with a staggering $100 billion in net income in fiscal 2022 alone. Here are two reasons even more profits likely are ahead for Apple and its shareowners -- as well as a key risk that investors need to be mindful of. 1. Apple&#039;s ecosystem is becoming stickier Once people buy an Apple device, they tend to remain loyal customers. This strong user retention is a major reason for the company&#039;s success. It generates bountiful recurring revenue, both from repeat device sales and ongoing service subscriptions. To make its offerings even more sticky, Apple is making a major push into financial services. The technology titan recently unveiled a new high-yield savings account it will offer in partnership with investment bank Goldman Sachs. With a compelling 4.15% annual yield, no minimum deposit or balance requirements, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation coverage, Apple&#039;s new savings accounts are likely to enjoy high demand from consumers. An Apple Card is necessary to open an account. Interest in the savings accounts should thus bolster the adoption of Apple&#039;s credit card and payment processing service, Apple Pay. Users can also easily deposit the cash rewards they earn from using the Apple Card into these savings accounts. Together, this burgeoning suite of financial products should help to lock Apple&#039;s customers into its product and service ecosystem. 2. A massive new growth market awaits Apple produced $394 billion in revenue in 2022, but it still has plenty of room for expansion. Much of this growth is set to occur in international markets, particularly India. With more than 1.4 billion people, India is now the world&#039;s most populous nation, according to the United Nations. And many of these people are planning to purchase their first Apple device. Apple already generates nearly $6 billion in annual revenue in India, according to Bloomberg. That&#039;s up roughly 50% from the prior year. To help drive those sales even higher, Apple opened its first retail store in the country earlier this month, and it plans to open many more. The company currently has a relatively small share of India&#039;s smartphone market, which is dominated by lower-priced devices. But the growing middle class is showing a propensity to pay up for higher-quality goods. Phones priced above $400 now account for 10% of India&#039;s total phone sales, up from 4% prior to the pandemic, according to Counterpoint Research. All told, Wedbush Securities estimates that Apple&#039;s annual sales in India could climb to $20 billion by 2025. This risk should not be overlooked Still, an investment in Apple is not without risk. Perhaps the biggest threat to the company&#039;s highly lucrative business model is its reliance on China for its manufacturing. That country&#039;s strict COVID-19 lockdowns created supply chain disruptions for Apple, and highlighted the risks posed by the tech company&#039;s concentrated production network. China&#039;s increasingly aggressive stance toward Taiwan and the potential for conflict in the region create an even more worrisome scenario. To mitigate these risks, Apple is working to diversify its supply chain. Yet the challenge isn&#039;t to just shift production to other countries but to do it in a way that preserves Apple&#039;s sky-high profit margins. Fortunately, India has emerged as a possible solution. Apple currently manufactures about 7% of its iPhones in India, and it plans to increase that figure to 25% in the coming years, according to Piyush Goyal, India&#039;s minister of commerce and industry. Other officials would also like to see that happen. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is spearheading an incentive program to boost production in India, which could make it easier for Apple&#039;s manufacturing partners to expand in this fast-growing country. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "2 ETFs That Could Turn $100 Per Week Into $790,000 or More",
        "content": "<p>Earning hundreds of thousands of dollars or more in the stock market may seem like something that&#039;s reserved for the ultra-wealthy or elite investors. But it&#039;s more attainable than you might think. You don&#039;t need to know a lot about investing to build wealth in the market, but you will need the right investments. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a smart option for many people, as they require much less maintenance than individual stocks yet can still see substantial returns. While there are many different ETFs to choose from, there are two funds that could potentially turn $100 per week into nearly $800,000 -- with very little effort on your part. 1. Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) tracks the S&amp;P 500, which means it includes the same stocks as the index itself and aims to mirror its performance over time. The S&amp;P 500 includes stocks from 500 of the largest and most stable companies in the U.S., and by investing in this ETF, you&#039;d own a stake in all of those stocks. The primary advantage of this ETF is that it&#039;s an incredibly safe long-term investment. The S&amp;P 500 itself has not only survived many recessions, bear markets, and crashes over the decades, but it&#039;s also earned positive average returns. If you invest in this ETF, your investment will likely take a hit during periods of volatility. But it&#039;s almost guaranteed to recover and go on to see positive returns over time. For those looking for a safe and reliable ETF, you can&#039;t go wrong with this one. Historically, the S&amp;P 500 itself has earned an average annual return of around 10% per year. Because this fund tracks the index, it&#039;s likely it will earn similar returns over the long run. If you were investing $100 per week while earning a 10% average annual return, here&#039;s approximately how much you could accumulate over time: Number of Years Total Savings 20 $275,000 25 $472,000 30 $790,000 35 $1,301,000 40 $2,124,000 Data source: Author&#039;s calculations via Investor.gov. Reaching $790,000 in total savings will take approximately 30 years at this rate, but the more time you give your money to grow, the more you&#039;ll earn. With an extra decade, you could build a portfolio worth well over $2 million. One other advantage of this ETF is that it offers a rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.03%. This is one of the lowest among its competitors, which could save you thousands of dollars in fees over time. 2. Vanguard Growth ETF The Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: VUG) is an investment designed to earn above-average returns. It includes 240 stocks from a variety of industries, though about half of the fund is comprised of stocks in the tech sector. Growth ETFs tend to carry more risk than S&amp;P 500 ETFs, as high-growth companies are often more volatile than their more established counterparts. The tech industry, in particular, is generally hit hard during periods of volatility, so this ETF may see more significant short-term downturns than the previous fund. That said, this ETF is a strong choice because it balances risk and reward. The top 10 holdings make up roughly half of this fund, and these stocks are behemoth corporations such as Amazon, Apple, Visa, and Home Depot. The rest of the fund, then, is comprised of up-and-coming stocks with the potential for explosive returns. This approach can limit your risk with the \"safe\" stocks, while still giving you plenty of room for growth. Since its inception in 2004, this fund has earned an average rate of return of just under 10% per year. While that may seem low, keep in mind that the tech sector is still struggling amid this downturn, so it&#039;s normal to see lower returns in times like these. Over the past 10 years, this ETF has earned an average return of around 13.6% per year. Even slightly higher-than-average returns can still go a long way. If, for example, you were to invest $100 per week while earning a 12% average annual return, here&#039;s roughly how much you&#039;d have over time: Number of Years Total Savings 20 $346,000 25 $640,000 30 $1,158,000 35 $2,072,000 40 $3,682,000 Source: Author&#039;s calculations via Investor.gov. There are never any promises when investing, so it&#039;s unclear exactly what types of returns this fund will earn over decades. This fund is also higher-risk, so be prepared for greater volatility. But because it&#039;s designed to earn higher-than-average returns, there&#039;s a better chance you&#039;ll beat the market with this ETF. Regardless of where you invest, time is your most valuable resource. The sooner you get started, the easier it will be to generate hundreds of thousands of dollars or more in the stock market. 10 stocks we like better than Vanguard Index Funds-Vanguard Growth ETF When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Apple fights $2 bln London lawsuit for 'throttling' millions of iPhones",
        "content": "<p>By Sam Tobin LONDON, May 2 (Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O urged a London tribunal on Tuesday to block a $2 billion mass lawsuit accusing it of hiding defective batteries in millions of iPhones by \"throttling\" them with software updates. The tech giant is facing a lawsuit worth up to 1.6 billion pounds plus interest, brought by consumer champion Justin Gutmann on behalf of iPhone users in the United Kingdom. Gutmann&#039;s lawyers argued in court filings that Apple concealed issues with batteries in certain phone models and \"surreptitiously\" installed a power management tool which limited performance. Apple said in written arguments that the lawsuit is \"baseless\" and strongly denies its iPhones&#039; batteries were defective, apart from in a small number of iPhone 6s models for which it offered free battery replacements. The company also says its power management update – introduced in 2017 to manage demands on older batteries or with a low level of charge – only reduced an iPhone 6&#039;s performance by an average of 10%. Gutmann on Tuesday asked London&#039;s Competition Appeal Tribunal to certify the case and allow it to proceed towards a trial. His lawyer Philip Moser referred to Apple&#039;s 2020 agreements to settle a U.S. class action and regulatory action by U.S. states over iPhone battery issues as showing Apple was not \"saying this never happened\". Apple had also committed to be \"clearer and more upfront\" with iPhone users about battery health to Britain&#039;s competition watchdog in 2019, Moser said. The company denies misleading its customers about iPhone battery issues and points to a public apology it issued in 2017, offering cheaper battery replacements to affected customers. Apple&#039;s lawyer David Wolfson said in court filings that the lawsuit effectively alleges that \"not all batteries could deliver the peak power demanded in all circumstances at all times\", which was common to all battery-powered devices.

According to the latest report from the Labor Department, the unemployment rate stands at 3.5%, indicating a significant recovery as more individuals have returned to work following the Covid pandemic. However, retailers like Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE:BBY) have expressed a cautious outlook due to a decline in consumer spending in certain categories like consumer electronics. This shift in consumer behavior has resulted in reduced sales of non-essential items, as individuals prioritize spending on essential goods due to inflationary pressures. The company also laid off hundreds of employees as consumer spending patterns are changing swiftly. </p> <p>Similarly, CNBC reported that Foxconn, a major supplier for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), announced a 10% decrease in profit for 2022 and predicted a decline in consumer electronics demand for the entire year ahead. This downbeat sentiment is in line with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s own cautious expectations for consumer sales. During Apple&#039;s first-quarter 2023 earnings report, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said that they anticipated double-digit declines in Mac and iPad sales for the upcoming March quarter, compared to the previous year. However, the decline in iPhone sales is expected to be less significant in the March quarter compared to the December quarter. Foxconn plans to expand its operations beyond mainland China and has identified exploring new markets as a key priority for the company in 2023.</p> <p>Despite the near-term outlook muted because of a global recession, the consumer electronics market is expected to witness sustained growth in the coming years, primarily driven by advancements in technology and rapidly changing consumer preferences. These factors will fuel innovation and competition within the industry. According to the Global Consumer Electronics Market report published by Reports Insights, the market achieved a value of $740.79 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach a market size of over $1063.39 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.62%. The expansion of technologies is a key factor propelling the growth of the consumer electronics market. The increasing demand for compact wearable devices such as earbuds, smartwatches, and smart glasses is driving the growth further. Furthermore, the rising trend of remote work has led to increased adoption of computing devices, contributing to the growth of the consumer electronics market.</p> <div> Story continues </div> <p>The consumer electronics industry is dominated by the highly profitable smartphone business, which holds a significant share of the overall market.

They have an explicit strategy to sacrifice gross margins from their TVs to further develop the audience for their smart TV offering, a competitor to Roku. I purchased the shares expecting the thesis to play out over a number of years, so I intend to monitor the company and its results as we move forward. Their first quarter results reflected strength in their Platform (Smart TV) segment, which will be their primary source of profit going forward. Further, the news that Netflix and other streaming companies are considering subscriptions that include advertising is positive news. In some ways, what is old is new again, as this development is somewhat of a return to the dual-revenue-stream model cable TV channels use. The shift towards more streaming programming including advertisements is a positive for Vizio, since they may be able to monetize the ads directly or indirectly. I’ll keep you posted on their progress.”</p>  </div> 6.

        "title": "How Will Apple's Earnings Trend As iDevice Sales Slow",
        "content": "<p>Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is slated to report its Q2 FY’23 results on May 4, reporting on a quarter that likely saw the company’s sales contract amid weaker demand for computing devices and headwinds in the digital services business. We estimate that Apple’s revenue will come in at about $93 billion for the quarter, roughly in line with consensus estimates and about 4% lower compared to last year. We estimate that earnings will stand at close to $1.45 per share, compared to a consensus of $1.43 per share. So what are some of the trends that are likely to drive Apple’s results? See our interactive dashboard analysis on Apple Earnings Preview for more details on how Apple’s revenues and earnings are likely to trend for the quarter. We expect to see slower sales of iPhones, amid economic concerns and weaker consumer spending. However, this could be partially offset by improved availability of the flagship iPhone Pro devices, which remained undersupplied through the holiday quarter. Apple’s other computing devices are also likely to see slower sales. While the iPad could see demand cool versus last year, as the remote working and learning trend seen through the Covid-19 pandemic tapers off. Mac sales are expected to see a more severe slump. For perspective, IDC estimates that Apple’s Mac sales declined by close to 40.5% in Q1 2023. However, this could be offset, in part, by sales of pricier devices such as the Macbook Pros and the all-new Macbook Air. We will be closely watching the performance of Apple’s services business. Services sales have slowed down meaningfully, with revenue growing by just 6.4% in Q1 FY’23 and by about 5% in Q4 FY’22, compared to double-digit levels in the year-ago quarter. This is concerning, given that services are very lucrative, with segment gross margins typically standing at over 70%. The decline is likely being led by the AppStore, with people spending less on gaming and apps as Covid-19 eases. So is Apple stock a buy ahead of earnings? While Apple stock could move slightly higher if it beats earnings, we believe the stock is fundamentally overvalued at current levels of about $170 per share. The stock trades at about 28x forward earnings, which we believe is high, given that Apple’s earnings are poised to contract this year per consensus estimates, with revenue growth projected to remain slow over the next year as well. We value Apple at about $160 per share, about 5% below the market price. See our analysis of Apple Valuation for more details on what’s driving our price estimate for Apple and how it compares with peers. What if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead?

        "title": "Will Shiba Inu Reach $1? I'll Show You 1 Way It Could",
        "content": "<p>Shiba Inu became the darling of the cryptocurrency industry in 2021 when it generated a gain of 43,800,000%, which could&#039;ve made millionaires out of investors for an outlay of just $3, assuming their timing was perfect. But risk appetite evaporated from the financial markets in 2022, which sent speculative assets like Shiba Inu plunging, and the token remains 89% below its all-time high. Certain realities about its lack of mainstream adoption are also setting in, which is hindering any recovery attempts. But sentiment surrounding the broader crypto industry has improved in 2023, so could Shiba Inu stage another historic run? There might actually be a way the token could soar to $1, but it won&#039;t have the effect most investors think it will. Here are the details. Image source: Getty Images. The crypto industry is coming off its worst year ever Last year was one to forget for cryptocurrency investors. A series of high-profile collapses across the industry reached a crescendo in November when global brokerage firm FTX fell into bankruptcy owing customers an estimated $3 billion. Regulators are still attempting to track down missing funds, and the saga has caused many investors to shun the crypto industry. According to a survey conducted by business news network CNBC at the end of last year, just 8% of Americans have a positive view on cryptocurrencies. That environment is less than ideal for speculative tokens like Shiba Inu, which are seldom used in the real world for transactions. That&#039;s one of the reasons it&#039;s struggling to climb back toward its all-time highs -- just 746 businesses worldwide accept the token as payment for goods and services, which means consumers have little reason to own it. Without adoption, sustaining value over the long term is an uphill battle. The Shiba Inu community is trying to create new use cases for the token, including with a metaverse (virtual world), and a Layer-2 blockchain solution called Shibarium, which is designed to reduce the cost and friction when transacting. But so far, nothing has really moved the needle. Here&#039;s one way Shiba Inu could reach $1 Shiba Inu has a supply issue. There are 589.3 trillion tokens in circulation, which is why its current price of $0.00001 features so many decimal places. The math is simple: If Shiba Inu rose to $1, it would have a total market capitalization of $589.3 trillion, making it the most valuable asset in the world by a wide margin. For a little perspective, Apple is currently the largest company on the planet and it&#039;s worth $2.6 trillion as of this writing. That&#039;s why the Shiba Inu community has been working to reduce that enormous supply figure by burning tokens, which removes them from circulation forever. Investors can participate by sending their tokens to a dead wallet, or by using services that commit a portion of their profits to the cause. They include streaming a certain music playlist and YouTube channel, using the Shiba Search internet search engine, and buying coffee from the Shiba Coffee company. Theoretically, as tokens are burned, Shiba Inu&#039;s price will increase in equal proportion. For Shiba Inu to rise to $1 from here purely through the burn mechanism, the community would have to eliminate 99.9998% of the tokens currently in circulation, bringing the total down from 589.3 trillion to just 6 billion. Here&#039;s the first problem: The community burned just 3.3 billion tokens in the past month. That&#039;s a burn rate of 39.6 billion per year, meaning it would take a whopping 14,881 years to burn supply down to 6 billion. But here&#039;s the second, and much bigger problem. In the end, there would simply be 6 billion tokens in supply trading at $1 per token, placing Shiba Inu&#039;s market capitalization at $6 billion -- exactly where it is today. No investor would see an actual increase in the value of their holdings. Therefore, even if humans found a way to live for thousands of years, it would be an exercise in futility. 10 stocks we like better than Shiba Inu When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "<p>Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will announce its second-quarter financials on Thursday, May 4, 2023. Wall Street expects Apple’s top line to drop, reflecting the ongoing weakness in product sales. However, the momentum in Services revenue could continue to support overall sales. Analysts Weigh In Analysts expect Apple to report revenue of $92.91 billion in the second quarter, reflecting a year-over-year decline of about 4.5%. Momentum in Services sales and the easing of supply-chain headwinds and improvement in China could support overall revenue, but tough year-over-year comparisons and pressure on consumer spending due to high inflation and interest rates will likely hurt Mac sales. Monness analyst Brian White expects AAPL’s Q2 revenue to decrease by 6%. In a note to investors dated May 1, White expects iPhone sales to improve compared to Q1. However, he sees iPhone revenue declining by 4% year-over-year. The analyst projects a 43% drop in Mac revenue, reflecting weak consumer spending trends and normalization in demand post the easing of COVID-led lockdowns. Nonetheless, White forecasts a 7% growth in Apple’s Services sales, reflecting a growing installed base of active devices and an increase in paid subscriptions. Along with White, Goldman Sachs analyst Mike Ng sees a 3% drop in Apple’s Q2 revenues. On April 24, the analyst said he expects a 5% fall in AAPL’s product revenues. However, he expects iPhone sales to offset the weakness in Mac revenue. Given the ongoing pressure on its top line, analysts project AAPL’s earnings to decline in Q2. Wall Street expects AAPL to post earnings of $1.43 a share in Q2, compared with an EPS of $1.52 in the prior year’s quarter. Is Apple a Buy, Sell, or Hold? Apple stock has gained about 30% year-to-date. Further, analysts maintain their bullish outlook on AAPL stock. It has received 21 Buy, four Hold, and one Sell recommendations ahead of Q2, reflecting a Strong Buy consensus rating. The analysts’ average price target of $175.05 implies 3.86% upside potential. Bottom Line While Apple’s top line is projected to decline in Q2, iPhone sales could show improvement. Further, the easing of supply-chain headwinds and ongoing strength in the Services segment bodes well for growth. Apple could also provide a favorable update on share buybacks or dividends, which could act as a catalyst.

        "title": "PREVIEW-Apple results could mark weak finish to Big Tech earnings",
        "content": "<p>By Yuvraj Malik and Aditya Soni May 3 (Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O will likely report a more than 4% drop in revenue, its second straight quarterly decline, weighed down by consumers shunning non-essential purchases such as iPhones and Mac computers and slowing growth at its services business. The results on Thursday from the world&#039;s most valuable company will follow better-than-expected earnings from U.S. technology peers, which had raised hopes that the worst may be over for a sector that has laid off tens of thousands this year. Apple, an industry outlier with no mass layoffs so far, is set to post its first ever revenue declines across product lines, even as iPhone demand and production recovered in China after pandemic-driven disruptions last year. \"Apple is seeing moderate headwinds in its hardware businesses as iPhones face modest contraction in premium device demand and the iPad and Mac businesses could be weighed down by consumer and enterprise trends,\" analysts at Cowen and Co said. Hardware sales are set to decline over 7% to $71.93 billion in the second quarter, according to 23 analysts polled by Visible Alpha. Mac sales, which account for nearly a tenth of Apple&#039;s revenue, likely fell by a quarter, while revenue from flagship iPhone is estimated to have declined by over 3%. Global PC shipments slumped by nearly a third between January and March, according to data from research firm IDC, led by an over 40% drop in those sold by Apple. The global smartphone market, meanwhile, shrank 13% for a fifth straight quarter of decline. CHINA CHEER Apple investors, however, would be encouraged by a recovery in China, the company&#039;s third-largest market. \"The reopening of China, both from the supply chain and the consumer demand standpoint, works in Apple&#039;s favor,\" said Tom Forte of D.A. Davidson, who expects iPhone sales there to rise. A near 1% pullback in the dollar .DXY during the quarter is also a bright spot in what is typically a weak period following the holiday shopping season, analysts said. Revenue in its services business, a key growth engine for Apple and home to its App Store and video streaming service, likely rose about 6%, according to Visible Alpha. That would mark its second lowest growth rate since at least the first quarter of fiscal 2017. \"For Apple, it is much more about a user growth story than a unit growth story,\" said KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brandon Nispel, who believes efforts to grow market share in developing economies such as India and Brazil will be crucial. He expects Apple to have added 30 million users to its active installed user base - the number of active Apple devices in the world. That figure stood at 2 billion as of end December. The company is ramping up its manufacturing and store presence in India as it looks to diversify its supply chain and gain consumers. The market could contribute $20 billion to annual revenue by 2025, brokerage Wedbush estimates.

        "content": "<p><p>By Yuvraj Malik and Aditya Soni</p> <p>(Reuters) - Apple Inc will likely report a more than 4% drop in revenue, its second straight quarterly decline, weighed down by consumers shunning non-essential purchases such as iPhones and Mac computers and slowing growth at its services business.</p> <div></div> <p>The results on Thursday from the world&#039;s most valuable company will follow better-than-expected earnings from U.S. technology peers, which had raised hopes that the worst may be over for a sector that has laid off tens of thousands this year.</p> <p>Apple, an industry outlier with no mass layoffs so far, is set to post its first ever revenue declines across product lines, even as iPhone demand and production recovered in China after pandemic-driven disruptions last year.</p> <p>\"Apple is seeing moderate headwinds in its hardware businesses as iPhones face modest contraction in premium device demand and the iPad and Mac businesses could be weighed down by consumer and enterprise trends,\" analysts at Cowen and Co said.</p> <p>Hardware sales are set to decline over 7% to $71.93 billion in the second quarter, according to 23 analysts polled by Visible Alpha.</p> <p>Mac sales, which account for nearly a tenth of Apple&#039;s revenue, likely fell by a quarter, while revenue from flagship iPhone is estimated to have declined by over 3%.</p> <p>Graphic: Apple earnings preview - https://www.reuters.com/graphics/GLOBAL-MARKETS/THEMES/byvrlewxrve/Apple%20earnings_T5.png</p> <p>Global PC shipments slumped by nearly a third between January and March, according to data from research firm IDC, led by an over 40% drop in those sold by Apple.

Davidson, who expects iPhone sales there to rise.</p> <div> Story continues </div> <p>A near 1% pullback in the dollar during the quarter is also a bright spot in what is typically a weak period following the holiday shopping season, analysts said.</p> <p>Revenue in its services business, a key growth engine for Apple and home to its App Store and video streaming service, likely rose about 6%, according to Visible Alpha. That would mark its second lowest growth rate since at least the first quarter of fiscal 2017.</p> <div> <div></div> </div> <p>\"For Apple, it is much more about a user growth story than a unit growth story,\" said KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brandon Nispel, who believes efforts to grow market share in developing economies such as India and Brazil will be crucial.</p> <p>He expects Apple to have added 30 million users to its active installed user base - the number of active Apple devices in the world. That figure stood at 2 billion as of end December.</p> <p>The company is ramping up its manufacturing and store presence in India as it looks to diversify its supply chain and gain consumers.

        "content": "<p>Apple’s AAPL second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, to be reported on May 4, are expected to reflect the impacts of the sluggishness in the Services business. The segment, which includes revenues from the App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Arcade, Apple TV+, Apple News+ and Apple Card, accounted for 17.7% of sales in first-quarter fiscal 2023. Although Apple’s business primarily runs around its flagship iPhone, the Services portfolio has emerged as the company’s new cash cow. Apple currently has more than 935 million paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. The App Store has been continuing to draw the attention of prominent developers from around the world, helping the company offer appealing apps to drive the App Store traffic, thereby expanding the subscriber base. The company expected Services revenue growth to be negatively impacted by challenging macroeconomic conditions, unfavorable forex, as well as weakness in digital advertising and gaming. Services revenues grew 6.4% year over year to $20.77 billion in the fiscal first quarter. Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) Apple Inc. revenue-ttm | Apple Inc.

But a miss could mean increased pressure on rival tech stocks, just as the sector looks to finally move past its COVID-induced hangover.</p> Apple could swing its rivals <p>Analysts expect Apple to report revenue of $92.6 billion for the second quarter, a 4.8% decline from the $97.3 billion Apple brought in during the same quarter last year.

Worse still would be any signal that revenue will come in weaker than anticipated in Q3.

What to watch for:</p><p>LAST QUARTER/GUIDANCE: Last quarter, Qualcomm reported Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $2.37 on revenue of $9.46B, compared to analysts&#039; estimates for $2.34 and $9.6B, respectively. Along with the report, the company guided for Q2 adjusted EPS of $2.05-$2.25 on revenue of $8.7B-$9.5B. At the time, analysts were expecting Qualcomm to report Q2 EPS of $2.26 on revenue of $9.55B, but those figures have since fallen to $2.16 and $9.1B, respectively.</p><p>SUSQUEHANNA UPGRADE: In mid-March, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland upgraded Qualcomm to Positive from Neutral with a price target of $140, up from $130. In April 2021, the firm called for the top of the semiconductor cycle, but in March 2023 called for the bottom in this cycle, at least for consumer, PC, and handset-related names. Asian checks suggest Chinese handset sell-through was better for both January and February, which the analyst calls \"the first positive surprises in our data for over a year.\" Rolland also believes Qualcomm&#039;s push into the midrange \"comes at a fortuitous time given China&#039;s reopening\" and it sees the Apple (AAPL) business as \"now de-risked.\"</p><p>EU CHIP SUBSIDY PLAN: Last month, the European Commission said it \"welcomed\" a political agreement reached between the European Parliament and the EU Member States on the European Chips Act, proposed by the Commission on February 8, 2022, including on the budget. \"Semiconductors are at the center of strong geostrategic interests, and of the global technological race,\" the EU said. \"For this reason, the Commission proposed the European Chips Act, which strengthens European competitiveness and resilience in this strategic sector... Recent shortages of semiconductors have highlighted Europe&#039;s dependency on a limited number of suppliers outside of the EU, in particular Taiwan and South-East Asia for manufacturing of chips, and the United States for their design. To respond to critical dependencies, the European Chips Act will strengthen manufacturing activities in the Union, stimulate the European design ecosystem, and support scale-up and innovation across the whole value chain. Through the European Chips Act, the European Union aims to reach its target to double its current global market share to 20% in 2030. ...In addition to the Chips for Europe Initiative, the second pillar of the European Chips Act will incentivise public and private investments in manufacturing facilities for chipmakers and their suppliers. This will contribute to the overall public investments in the sector estimated at EUR 43B.\"</p><p>DIVIDEND: In early March, Qualcomm announced that its Board of Directors has approved a 7% increase in the company&#039;s quarterly cash dividend. The quarterly cash dividend will increase from 75c to 80c per share of common stock and will be effective for quarterly dividends payable after March 23. This dividend increase will raise the annualized dividend payout to $3.20 per share of common stock.</p><p>More By This Author:</p></div></p>"

Undoubtedly, the latest product offering to come from Apple’s fintech push comes at a pretty exciting time, at least through the eyes of a potential market disruptor. As Apple wanders deeper into financial services with its disruptor hat on, it’s hard to be anything but bullish on the firm.</p>  <p id=\"p_adedd64d88a1b54fe75d946a847a3d68\" class=\"img_p\" ><img src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-101.png\" id=\"adedd64d88a1b54fe75d946a847a3d68\" onerror=\"javascript: this.parentNode.style.display='none'; \" /></p><p></p>  U.S. Regional Banks Feel Pressure. Apple May Be Seeing an Opportunity <p>The U.S. banks have been under a lot of selling pressure for well over a month now. Indeed, it all started with SVB Financial’s failure. As other regionals fell under the weight of the Fed’s interest rate hikes, a full-blown U.S. regional banking crisis came to be. Bad bond investments eroded depositor confidence, eventually paving the way for a bank run.</p> <p>It’s difficult to tell when this pressure hurting the regional banks will be contained. Over a span of a month and a half, we’ve witnessed the second, third, and fourth-largest bank failures in U.S. history. After such a wave of failures, it’s no mystery why some depositors feel a bit on edge. While larger U.S. banks have mostly been steady in this storm, they too could stand to lose a bit as depositors look to consider alternatives.</p> <p>Of course, there have always been fintech firms, neobanks, and smaller financial institutions that have offered highly-competitive rates on deposits. That said, never before has there been a respected, consumer-centric behemoth of a firm like Apple getting in on the financial services space. Apple’s a $2.65 trillion company that many tech-savvy users already trust day-to-day with their data. For many Apple users, this trust has been built for well over a decade.</p> <p>When it comes to financial services, trust and reliability play a massive role in where depositors or investors choose to take their business. Of course, competitive rates always help, but they’re not always the determining factor. With Apple pulling the curtain on its high-rate savings account, I think the firm could stand to win a lot of business as confidence in banks takes a modest blow with every regional bank that goes down.</p> Apple and Goldman Could Continue to Make Moves in Consumer Banking <p>Apple may be a relative newcomer to the financial services space, but it has all the tools it needs to thrive. With a bit of help from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), I believe Apple is the one firm that could upend the financial industry as we know it. Undoubtedly, the business of banking can be profitable, but it can also be wildly turbulent when the tides turn. With Apple teaming up with Goldman (and perhaps other banks in the future), the firm may find itself with the ability to enjoy more of the feast to be had within financial services minus potential indigestion.</p> <p>At this juncture, many depositors may be inclined to take money out of those sub-2% savings accounts and stash it with Apple, where they can make more than double the interest. </p> <p>Reportedly, 69% of Apple Card holders expressed interest in opening up a savings account. Younger consumers, specifically those in the Millennial and Gen Z cohort, may be inclined to get an Apple Card if it means gaining excess to such a competitive savings account.</p> <p>According to a report conducted by Forbes, Apple’s high-yield savings account brought in nearly $1 billion worth of deposits in just four days. That’s impressive. </p> <p>Apple has a competitive rate, a reputation built on decades of trust, and a brand that’s virtually impossible to match. It’s no mystery why Apple’s foray into banking has been met with such profound early success.</p> Is AAPL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts? <p>Turning to Wall Street, AAPL stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 25 analyst ratings, there are 21 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average Apple price target is $177.23, implying upside potential of 5.8%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $120.00 per share to a high of $205.00 per share.</p>  <p id=\"p_0b0999699af4551a23070a5466c99207\" class=\"img_p\" ><img src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-100-1024x344.png\" id=\"0b0999699af4551a23070a5466c99207\" onerror=\"javascript: this.parentNode.style.display='none'; \" /></p><p></p>  The Bottom Line on Apple Stock and Its Fintech Push <p>Apple has always been about doing things better than the competitors it seeks to go up against. As select banks face a crisis of confidence, I’d look for more people to take their money over to Apple, not just for the higher rate but for greater convenience and more peace of mind.</p> <p>Going into earnings, I’d look for more details about Apple’s fintech push. Even if the quarterly results fail to impress, commentary on Apple’s direction could be a needle-mover for the stock.</p>   </div> </div></p>"

        "title": "Time to Buy Apple Stock for More Upside as Earnings Approach?",
        "content": "<p>Edging out some nice gains this year all eyes are on Apple (AAPL) this week with the company set to release its fiscal second-quarter earnings on Thursday, May 4. Apple’s performance has been strong outperforming most of its big tech peers such as Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) while easily topping the broader indexes. With Apple stock now up +30% in 2023, investors are wondering if strong second-quarter results and positive guidance can help the computer and technology innovator divvy up more gains like it is historically known to do. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Q2 Preview Apple’s second-quarter earnings are expected to dip -5% at $1.44 per share compared to EPS of $1.52 in Q2 2022. Sales are forecasted to be down -4% from the prior year quarter at $93.32 billion. Still, Apple’s stock tends to pop after beating earnings expectations and investors are certainly hoping the company can do so. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Wall Street will be monitoring Apple&#039;s guidance to see if operating conditions are stabilizing going forward. Last quarter, CEO Tim Cook stated a stronger dollar, production issues in China, and the broader challenges in the macroeconomic environment affected results. To that point, Apple most recently missed its first quarter top and bottom line expectations by a slight margin. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Notably, Q1 sales missed top-line estimates by -3% and declined -5% YoY which was the largest quarterly drop since 2016 and the first decline in quarterly revenue since 2019. With Apple expected to post another quartely decline in sales, Wall Street will be seeing if the company&#039;s outlook indicates a stop to the bleeding. With that being said, the sentiment toward tech stocks is very positive as inflation begins to ease and the ability to offer positive guidance could extend Apple’s rally. Growth &amp; Outlook According to Zacks estimates, Apple’s sales are now forecasted to be down -1% this year but rebound and rise 7% in FY24 to $414.61 billion. More importantly, fiscal 2024 would be a 59% increase from 2019 pre-pandemic sales of $260.17 billion. On the bottom line, earnings are projected to slightly decline by -1% in FY23 but jump 11% in FY24 at $6.66 per share. Fiscal 2024 would represent a very impressive 124% growth in EPS since the pandemic with 2019 earnings at $2.97 per share. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Performance &amp; Valuation With its growth story seemingly intact, investors may be more intrigued by the strong performance in Apple stock this year. To that point, Apple’s stellar growth has led to the stock soaring +951% over the last decade. This has crushed the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq, while also topping the performance of Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft stocks. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Trading around $168 per share, Apple stock trades at 28X forward earnings which is nicely below its decade-long high of 38.6X but above the median of 16X. Although this is above the industry average of 9.1X and the S&amp;P 500’s 18.9X, Apple is the clear-cut leader in its space and Wall Street has historically been ok with paying a premium for AAPL shares due to the company’s growth potential. Plus, when considering Apple’s growth rate its PEG ratio of 2.1 is slightly below the industry average and not too far above the S&amp;P 500’s 1.72 although the optimum level is less than 1.0. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Bottom Line Apple stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) going into its fiscal second quarter report. Looking at Apple’s historical performance and the expected growth next year there could still be a nice amount of upside from current levels. However, more upside in Apple stock will largely depend on the company’s ability to offer positive or better-than-expected guidance and put an end to the decline in quarterly sales.

        "content": "<p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div><p>The current banking crisis has claimed the scalp of three banks and another is teetering on the brink. Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who has been vociferous throughout the development, discussed the crisis again in a lengthy tweet.</p><p>What Happened: The regional banking system is at risk, said Ackman, who runs the hedge fund Pershing Square. Silicon Valley Bank&#039;s collapse served as a warning for uninsured depositors and the rapid rise in rates \"impaired assets and drained assets, he said.</p><p>\"Zeroing out shareholders and bondholders massively increased banks&#039; cost of capital,\" the fund manager said.</p><div><div></div></div><div></div><p>He also warned of looming commercial real estate losses. Incidentally, Warren Buffett&#039;s trusted lieutenant Charlie Munger recently sounded out a similar alarm.</p><p>The unsavory development on the banking front has resulted in the emergence of higher-yielding, more user-friendly alternatives such as Apple, Inc.&#039;s AAPL savings account announced recently. Reports suggest the tech giant was successful in amassing nearly $1 billion in deposits within four days of the launch.</p><p>Government’s Failure? By refusing to update and expand Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation&#039;s insurance regime, the federal agency has worsened the situation, Ackman said. After SVB&#039;s collapse, Ackman was among those who called upon the FDIC to announce a 100% guarantee.</p><div>  <div></div>    </div><p></p><p>First Republic would not have failed if the FDIC temporarily guaranteed deposits while working on a new guarantee regime, the fund manager said.</p><p>\"Instead, we watch the dominoes fall at a great systemic and economic cost.\"</p><p>\"Banking is a confidence game,\" Ackman said, adding that \"at this rate, no regional bank can survive bad news or bad data, as a stock price plunge inevitably follows.\"</p><p>Insured and insured deposits are then withdrawn, forcing the banks to explore strategic alternatives, he said. This means an FDIC shutdown over the coming weekend, he added.</p><p>Advantage Big Banks: Ackman noted that the globally systemically important banks have an unfair competitive advantage as \"too-big-to-fail\" means only their uninsured depositors can sleep soundly. He sees regional banks at \"grave risk\" until the \"playing field is leveled.\"</p><p>Time Running Out: \"As each domino falls, the next weakest bank begins to wobble,\" Ackman said. Unless buyers are rewarded for betting on a wobbling bank, he suggested that there would be no bids, and it would be sold at throwaway prices.</p><p>\"We are running out of time to fix the problem,\" Ackman said, adding that \"we need a systemwide deposit guarantee regime now.”</p><p>Ackman&#039;s rant comes against the backdrop of PacWest Bancorp&#039;s PACW announcement that it is exploring strategic options. This sent the stock tumbling by over 52% in the after-hours session on Wednesday. First Republic folded up early this week and was sold to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM. The month of March saw the winding down of SVB and Signature Bank.</p><p>The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index BKX fell 1.89% to $74.82 on Wednesday.

        "content": "<p>For Immediate Release Chicago, IL – May 4, 2023 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL. Apple (AAPL) Earnings Preview: Bull vs. Bear Case Apple, the unequivocal king of the stock market reports earnings Thursday, May 4 after the market closes. As the world’s leading consumer products and technology company, Apple’s earnings act as an important bellwether for the broader economy. Apple stock has not disappointed this year and the sturdiness of Apple’s returns simply cannot be understated. The stock is up 30% YTD, 300% over the last five years, and 1100% over the last 10 years. It isn’t flawless though, as it was down -30% during 2022. However, it has nearly earned it all back in the first four months of 2023. Earnings Expectations Analysts are expecting a YoY decline in Q2 sales, which isn’t great, but also not terrible. Something I don’t often see mentioned about Apple is the strong seasonal tendencies of its revenues. In the quarterly revenues chart below we see revenues regularly explode higher following the holiday season and are then mostly stagnant through the rest of the year. But Q1 2023 sales were below Q1 2022, which shows that there was a YoY slowdown in the most recent holiday season. Additionally, analyst earnings revisions have been mixed, which gives Apple a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Q2 expectations are looking down a bit, which lines up with market expectations of a broader economic slowdown in the second half of the year. Also concerning, last quarter Apple posted a rare sales and earnings miss. Last quarter marked Apple’s first earnings miss since 2016, which was just -$0.01 below expectations and its second sales miss since 2016, which was also just below expectations. Analysts are expecting earnings growth to decline -5.3% YoY to $1.44 a share. The rest of the year is expected to be mostly flat as well, however next year’s earnings are projected to pick up significantly. Bear Case Shorting Apple is almost never advised, and although I don’t consider this my base case it is important to address the primary risks. AAPL stock has acted as an incredible haven this year and its returns make up 25% of S&amp;P 500’s total returns YTD. At this point investors are treating Apple stock like a Treasury bond, and it has considerably outperformed Treasuries. But is that realistic? Will some doubt start creeping into investors’ minds and cause Apple to roll over. Apple’s most critical profit center is the iPhone, which makes up 52% of total revenue. In the Q1 report, we saw that iPhone sales were down YoY. Management chalked this up to a one-time event and blamed the miss on supply issues related to the lockdowns in China. What if it was a demand issue though? What if we are moving past peak iPhone? The chart below shows total annual smartphone sales, which have clearly peaked. This means that Apple is already fighting an uphill battle. Furthermore, iPhone quality and longevity is improving, and so are prices, and the length of payment plans. I know personally, the iPhone 11 Pro I bought in 2019 still feels as good as new. Market share is another important consideration. Apple currently has an impressive 23% market share of global smartphones. How much room does Apple have to continue to grow this figure? The massive Chinese middle class is a very important segment for Apple to target, but what if they start to prefer the Chinese branded phones? Oppo and Xiaomi have made some extremely compelling new phones, particularly their smart flip phones. Flip phones are extremely interesting because they begin to blend phone and tablet products. Flip phones are a product Apple doesn’t have and I haven’t heard rumors of anything in the pipeline. The black swan event would be a military conflict between the US and China. In this worst case scenario, it would be highly unlikely that the civil relations between Apple and China continue. The concerns listed are more hypotheticals and questions. Of course, Apple has defied all investor logic for over a decade now, and its downfall is an extremely unlikely event. But doubt and fear can move a stock. Is the next 20% move in Apple stock higher or lower? I don’t know, but there are certainly catalysts the give potential to the -20% possibility. Technicals There isn’t a clean chart pattern to trade AAPL from, but this large range looks significant to me. The $180 level is resistance and $130 support. Right now, price is in no-mans land in the middle of this large range. If price can clear the $180 level, resistance should turn into support, and the next multi-year leg higher in Apple should commence. However, a rejection at $180 would be very significant. If the stock can’t clear that level, it may be indicative of not just Apple, but the market more broadly. With a recession likely coming later this year, it is possible we will see Apple retest the high of the range, and then as the recession takes hold, swing back down to the bottom of the range. Rather than trying to short the stock, investors would be better off waiting for price to come back down to the $130-$140 buy zone. Valuation Apple is currently trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 28x, which is above the market average and above its five-year median of 24x. This certainly isn’t a cheap valuation, but as one of the world’s leading companies it isn’t particularly expensive either. This reasonable valuation doesn’t play well for the bears. Bottom Line Apple is a juggernaut in the stock market, and its supremacy is undeniable. While I did lay out a bear case, it is more of an exercise in risk management than anything else. While the dynamics that have propelled Apple to this level over the past decade may change, the biggest risk currently is an economic slowdown. Apple brought luxury to the masses, so if the average person begins to feel the heat of a slowing economy, they probably won’t be buying a new iPhone. But there is a path where the recession is not too bad, and in that case, Apple continues to chug along as the world’s leading stock. Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks&#039; Top Stocks?

        "title": "Warren Buffett's Big AI Bet",
        "content": "<p>Sometimes it&#039;s better to be lucky than good. But the true greats like Warren Buffett are both. His holding company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) began buying shares of iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in 2016. That investment has grown into the holding company&#039;s most significant position through sheer outperformance. That&#039;s a heck of a stock pick. Buffett didn&#039;t realize it then, but fast-forward seven years and artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the economy as we speak. And as luck would have it, Berkshire&#039;s largest position, a whopping $155 billion stake in Apple, has Berkshire positioned to benefit from all that AI has to offer. Here is what you need to know. AI clues in Apple&#039;s products Apple has built an empire as a consumer electronics brand. It sells smartphones, computers, earbuds, and other accessories, followed by a variety of subscription services to help keep consumers locked into its ecosystem. From digital wallets to music, news, exercise, and gaming, there is a service for just about every digital need -- all accessible through your favorite Apple device. Today there are an estimated 1.5 billion active iPhone users alone, a massive user base that allows Apple to launch a new service and rapidly grow it. For example, Apple launched a buy now, pay later service, and with a simple iOS update, it can peddle it to as many users as it wants. This ecosystem is Apple&#039;s competitive advantage, and protecting it is the company&#039;s secret to long-term prosperity. Apple hasn&#039;t made waves in AI like some other big tech companies, but it&#039;s undoubtedly creeping into Apple&#039;s user services. Here are some examples: Photo editing features such as removing objects/backgrounds Predictive text on the keyboard Face ID with masks Crash detection in automobiles These changes all contribute to a better user experience, making it more likely you will continue upgrading your devices to the next generation. The system made Apple one of the decade&#039;s best investments. Could Siri become a game-changer? Much of the recent attention on AI centers around ChatGPT and other large language models, or chatbots, which can source information and reply to queries with conversation-like replies. Ironically, Apple had already broached this with its voice assistant Siri in 2011. The software has evolved, but most iPhone users are probably familiar with its limited capabilities. But integrating ChatGPT-like intelligence into Siri would be a potential game-changer, helping the voice assistant realize the potential that users have been waiting over a decade for. It was recently reported that Apple&#039;s engineers are actively looking at technologies like what powers ChatGPT. Though nothing is announced or imminent, it&#039;s an exciting possibility worth keeping an eye on. Should investors follow Warren&#039;s lead? Fortunately, you don&#039;t need AI to justify owning Apple stock -- the company&#039;s dominant ecosystem is plenty. However, there are some things you should consider before buying shares today. For example, Warren Buffett bought the stock for Berkshire in early 2016 when shares traded near a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of just 10. It turned out to be the cheapest valuation Apple would trade at ever since. Today shares trade at a P/E of nearly 30, which complicates things. Analysts believe Apple&#039;s earnings-per-share (EPS) growth will hover around 10% annually, making it harder to pull the trigger when the S&amp;P 500, which historically averages 10% annual returns, trades at a much lower valuation. AAPL PE Ratio data by YCharts Investors might benefit from waiting for shares to cool off after appreciating 30% since the start of the year. Many economists believe the U.S. is entering a recession, and the potential market turbulence might create a better buying opportunity. Be sure to keep Apple on your watchlist, though; the future is still bright for Buffett&#039;s (and Berkshire&#039;s) biggest holding. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks and euro sag ahead of expected ECB rate hike",
        "content": "<p>By Marc Jones LONDON, May 4 (Reuters) - Europe&#039;s stock markets and the euro sagged on Thursday as investors waited for another European Central Bank rate rise after the U.S. Federal Reserve signalled that its marathon hiking run might finally have hit pause. Another rout in regional U.S. bank shares overnight was hardly helping spirits, but with gold XAU= a whisker away from a record high and oil LCOc1 higher after a tough few days, focus was naturally on Frankfurt. Economists polled by Reuters expect the ECB to raise its borrowing rates for a seventh meeting in a row albeit the consensus is for a smaller quarter-point move rather than the half-point jumps it has been favouring recently. Matt Ward, a portfolio manager in the global equities team at Barings, said after the Fed had done a decent job \"threading the needle\" on Wednesday with its quarter point rise, the ECB would be watched closely. \"I am not in the camp of expecting a shock 50 basis point hike, but it&#039;s tough to see anything but a continuation of the hawkish tone,\" he said, pointing to the run of relatively robust data and low unemployment in key countries like Germany. That likely ECB tone was evident in the bond markets where benchmark government bond yields, which drive the cost of borrowing across Europe, were nudging higher. It was fractional stuff though. Germany&#039;s 10-year yield DE10YT=RR was up just 1 basis point at 2.26% and well down from where it was a month ago, while Italy&#039;s IT10YT=RR was only 2 bps higher at 4.152%. GVD/EUR \"We&#039;re basically in limbo right now until the decision,\" which comes at 1215 GMT, said Piet Haines Christiansen, chief strategist for fixed income at Danske Bank. The Fed on Wednesday dropped a key line that had been in its previously statements on the need for further rate increases, yet Fed Chair Jerome Powell pushed back against expectations that it will soon start cutting them. It will \"take some time\" for inflation to fall he said, so \"it would not be appropriate to cut rates\" this year. It came too as another U.S. regional bank, PacWest Bancorp PACW.O, reported troubles, reminding investors of the precarious health of some banks despite regulators&#039; assurances around containing the crisis that started with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March. \"The Fed decision was widely expected, so it didn&#039;t provide much of a shock to financial markets,\" said Tina Teng, market analyst at CMC Markets, in Auckland. \"However, I think the whole economic playout is not positive, especially the recent banking rout from the regional banks.\" APPLE EYED Frontrunning the ECB, Norway&#039;s central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.25%, as expected, and added it was likely to hike again in June, and beyond if the Norwegian crown stays weak. European stocks languished, with the STOXX 600 STOXX down 0.5% led by the carmaking and tourism sectors. .EU MSCI&#039;s 47-country index of world shares was slipping back into the red too .MIWD00000PUS as were Wall Street futures were tech giant Apple AAPL.O was due to reports earnings later. Asia had been more upbeat .MIAPJ0000PUS although trade has been thinned this week by Japanese holidays. China&#039;s benchmark index .CSI300 opened weaker as mainland markets returned after their May Day holidays but rebounded to end broadly unchanged. U.S. bond markets had rallied on Wednesday after the Fed meeting TYc1, as did Fed Funds futures 0#FF:, the latter implying a 52% chance of a rate cut as early as July. The Japanese yen JPY=EBS strengthened 0.1% versus the greenback at 134.51 per dollar, adding to its more than 1% rise on Wednesday. Back in Europe, the euro EUR=EBS turned lower having briefly flirting with a one-year peak, while Britain&#039;s pound GBP=D3 also went flat having touched a roughly 11-month high of $1.25925 in Asia. /FRX Mizuho analysts said the excitement over the implied pause in Fed tightening might be overdone and that the Fed&#039;s guidance \"is merely more contemplative\". Brent oil prices rose 1% to $72.83 a barrel on Thursday but it was a fraction of their 9% slump seen over past three days.

        "title": "Apple (AAPL) Q2 2023 Earnings: What to Expect",
        "content": "<p>Apple (AAPL) stock has gone on an impressive run, rising some 30% year to date, almost quadrupling the 7.7% rise in the S&amp;P 500 index. Its shares have returned about 7% just in the past thirty days, pushing the tech giant past a $2.5 trillion valuation. Is it time to take profits or can its momentum continue? These answers will be more clear when the company reports second quarter fiscal 2023 earnings results after the closing bell Thursday. It appears the tech giant has its mojo back after licking its wounds in 2022. Even with these strong returns, it’s hard to ignore the many catalysts that can keep shares rising. Last week, in partnership with Goldman Sachs (GS), Apple announced its entry into the banking system by offering a high-interest (4.15%) savings account for Apple Card holders. Also as part of its growing streaming investments, during the quarter Apple begun a 10-year partnership with Major League Soccer, launching MLS Season Pass which gives soccer fans access to every live MLS regular season game as well as the playoffs and MLS Cup. Let’s not forget Apple’s new line of hardware products such as the new MacBook Pro which are powered by the company’s new M2 Pro and M2 Max chips. These models offer not only robust performance, but they also use less energy which elongates battery life. Inflation continues to drive higher operating expenses for Apple, which remains a headwind for its profit margins. While iPhone sales generate a sizable portion of revenues, Apple’s collective high-margin Services businesses continue to grow. It remains to be seen if the Services segment, which generated 70%+ margins in 2022, can power the company through any near-term inflationary headwinds. In the three months that ended March, Wall Street expect the Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant to earn $1.43 per share on revenue of $92.98 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to $1.52 per share on revenue of $97.28 billion. For the full year, ending in October, earnings are expected to decline 2.6% year over year to $5.95 per share, while full-year revenue of $387.92 billion will decline 1.6% year over year. The tech giant has benefited from, among other things, the re-opening of China, its second-largest market. However, when it comes to the U.S., there is still concern regarding the strength of the consumer amid rising inflation and a possible recession. This continues to raise the question whether the company, which is highly reliant on iPhone sales, can ever return to its glory days of high growth. Elsewhere, another question is if Apple’s Services segment will grow fast enough to make up for any weakness in hardware, driven weak worldwide PC sales. Worldwide PC shipments reached 65.3 million units in Q4, falling close to 30% year over year. For the year, PC shipments declined more than 16% year over year. These weaknesses were felt in Q1 when Apple’s Mac revenue of $7.74 billion declined 28% year over year to $7.74 billion. Meanwhile, Q1 iPhone revenue of $65.78 billion declined 8% year over year to $65.78 billion. The weakness led to a quarterly miss on both the top and bottom lines, with the company earnings an adjusted EPS of $1.88 which missed by 7 cents, while Q1 revenue of $117.15 billion declined 5.5% year over year, missing estimates by $4.5 billion. It wasn’t all bad news, however. Apple’s overall install base crossed 2 billion active devices, hitting all-time high for all major product categories. What’s more, Services revenue, which includes subscriptions to products such as Apple TV+, iCloud storage and Apple Music, rose 6.3% year over year, reaching a record of $20.76 billion. On Thursday investors will be watching closely to see whether (or how) inflation might have impacted spending on Apple’s pricey hardware.

        "title": "Qualcomm amplifies chip gloom with 'sobering report'",
        "content": "<p>May 4 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc&#039;s QCOM.O shares sank nearly 8% premarket on Thursday after the chip designer signalled it would take longer for its crucial smartphone market to rebound from a post-pandemic slump. The company, which supplies to top handset makers Apple Inc AAPL.O and Samsung Electronics 005930.KS, was set to lose about $10 billion in market valuation, if the losses hold. Qualcomm&#039;s quarterly revenue outlook was the second time a chip firm has underwhelmed Wall Street this week. Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O slumped more than 9% on Wednesday after a dour forecast. \"While we believe investors were expecting a miss, this was admittedly a somewhat sobering report,\" said Bernstein analysts, among the 13 brokerages that cut price targets on Qualcomm&#039;s stock. The company blamed the weakness on the timing of purchases by a customer that only buys its cellular modems and China, where an expected post-COVID recovery was yet to materialize. Qualcomm did not name the modem customer, but analysts pointed to Apple, which will report results after markets close. \"The next two quarterly estimates will be adversely impacted by Apple as this leading modem-only customer purchased modems from Qualcomm in greater volumes earlier than normal due to the supply chain issues,\" said Michael Walkley of Canaccord Genuity. China will remain a headache with no timeline for a recovery there, while competition is deepening from Taiwan&#039;s MediaTek 2454.TW in the high-end smartphone chips, analysts said. \"We worry about customers mixing lower now that wafers are no longer scarce as well as increasing competition from Mediatek at the higher end,\" brokerage Evercore ISI said. Still, there were some encouraging signs for Qualcomm. Automotive revenue jumped 20% and the internet-of-things unit reported in line sales, indicating that Qualcomm&#039;s efforts to diversify away from the smartphone market were on track.

        "content": "<p>By Ankika Biswas and Sruthi Shankar May 4 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes were set for a lower open as news of PacWest Bancorp exploring strategic options deepened concerns about the health of regional banks, countering optimism from the Federal Reserve&#039;s signal of a likely pause in its interest rate hikes. PacWest Bancorp PACW.O tumbled 37.2% in premarket trading on Thursday after it confirmed it was exploring strategic options, including a sale, after shares of the regional lender and peers got hammered amid fears of a worsening banking crisis. Regulators seized troubled First Republic Bank and JPMorgan Chase JPM.N agreed to buy majority of its assets earlier this week, marking the largest U.S. bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis. Shares of other regional lenders such as KeyCorp KEY.N, Valley National Bancorp VLY.O and Zions Bancorp ZION.O fell between 7.7% and 9.6% on Thursday, while Western Alliance Bancorp WAL.N dropped 13.4% despite noting that it had not experienced unusual deposit outflows following the sale of First Republic. \"PacWest is more evidence that the U.S. banking crisis is not over yet,\" said Stuart Cole, chief macro economist at Equiti Capital. \"It (PacWest) does appear that it is struggling, and I would be very surprised if it was not for the same reasons as those before it ... the market is circling all these regional U.S. banks like a vulture, looking which one to pick off next.\" The U.S. central bank on Wednesday raised interest rates by 25 basis points to the 5.00%-5.25% range and signaled a pause in its policy tightening, giving officials time to assess the recent bank failures, U.S. debt ceiling situation and sticky inflation. However, U.S. stocks dropped on Wednesday after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that it was too soon to say with certainty that the rate-hike cycle was over as inflation remains the chief concern. U.S. interest rate futures priced in a pause in tightening at the Fed&#039;s June and July policy meetings, according to the CME&#039;s FedWatch tool, and also factored in a nearly 50% chance of rate cuts at the September meeting. Although the end of Fed&#039;s market-punishing rate-hike cycle may be in sight, uncertainty over stock valuations and the economic outlook are keeping investors on alert for more turbulence ahead. Major technology and growth stocks such as Meta Platforms Inc META.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O edged up on Thursday, helped by a fall in U.S. Treasury yields. US/ The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits increased last week as the labor market gradually softens amid higher interest rates, which are cooling demand in the economy. Apple Inc AAPL.O shares fell 1.5%, with the iPhone maker set to report quarterly results after the closing bell. At 8:34 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were down 68 points, or 0.20%, S&amp;P 500 e-minis EScv1 were down 11.5 points, or 0.28%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were down 18.25 points, or 0.14%. Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O slumped 7.4% after the chip designer&#039;s third-quarter forecasts missed estimates. Paramount Global Inc PARA.O dropped 17.2% after missing first-quarter revenue estimates as it added fewer subscribers at its flagship streaming service and advertisers cut back on spending.

        "title": "Apple beats revenue, profit estimate on iPhone sales growth",
        "content": "<p>By Stephen Nellis May 4 (Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O on Thursday reported quarterly revenue and profit above Wall Street&#039;s expectations, with iPhone sales rising and wearables sales slipping less than analysts had feared despite a continuing slump in the consumer electronics market and a cloudy economic outlook. Apple said sales for its fiscal second quarter ended April 1 fell 2.5% to $94.84 billion, better than analyst expectations of a 4.4% decline to $93 billion, according to data from Refinitiv. Profit was flat at $1.52 per share, compared with estimates of a 5.7% fall to $1.43 per share, according to Refinitiv data. Apple shares rose 2% in after-hours trading. A 1.5% rise in Apple&#039;s iPhone revenue contrasted with the broader consumer electronics industry, which is grappling with a decline in sales of smartphones, tablets and PCs as consumers and businesses who scooped up electronics during the pandemic tighten spending amid rising interest rates and economic uncertainty. The company also held its dividend and stock buyback programs roughly in line with its last update to them a year ago, approving $90 billion in additional buybacks. Apple CEO Tim Cook told Reuters in an interview on Thursday that the company set a fiscal second-quarter record for iPhone sales, thanks in part to picking up new users in markets such as India, where Cook recently traveled for the opening of the company&#039;s first retail stores in the country. \"We were thrilled by our performance in emerging markets,\" Cook said. \"We set records for the iPhone installed base in every geographic segment, and we had very strong &#039;new to&#039; (sales in) emerging markets, particularly in Brazil, India and Mexico.\" Cook also said supply-chain snarls have vanished. \"We had no material shortages at all during the quarter across any of the products,\" he said. But not all of Apple&#039;s business lines were immune to the electronics slump, with sales of Macs falling sharply while iPad revenue slipped. Sales in China also dropped 2.9% to $17.8 billion, a slightly larger drop than overall revenue. Other firms in the industry have predicted a rebound in the second half of the year, and Wall Street expects Apple to recover faster and show modest year-over-year revenue growth during its fiscal third quarter ending in June. Apple executives are expected to give a forecast on a conference call with investors later on Thursday. Apple has in recent weeks announced new service businesses such as a high-yield savings account, but investors are still waiting to see the company&#039;s next major hardware product. Bloomberg has reported the iPhone maker could unveil a mixed-reality headset as soon as next month, when it holds its annual software developer conference. IPhone sales rose 1.5% to $51.33 billion, compared with analyst expectations of a 3.3% decline to $48.9 billion, according to Refinitiv. Those results occurred against the backdrop of a 13% decline in global smartphone shipments during the first three months of 2023, during which the research firm Canalys said Apple gained market share against Android rivals. Mac sales fell more than 30% to $7.17 billion compared with analyst estimates of a 25% decline to $7.8 billion, according to Refinitiv. Apple&#039;s sales fared only slightly better than PC unit shipments in the market, which fell 33% in the calendar first quarter, according to Canalys data. Sales in Apple&#039;s wearables business, which includes devices like AirPods and the Apple Watch, fell less than 1% to $8.76 billion, compared with estimates of a 4.4% drop to $8.4 billion. Apple&#039;s biggest growth segment was its services business, which includes products like iCloud and Apple Pay, which grew 5.5% to $20.9 billion, in line with analyst expectations. Cook said Apple now has 975 million subscribers on its platform, which includes both Apple services and third-party apps, up from 935 million last quarter and an increase of 150 million from a year ago. Apple said its board of directors authorized a 24 cents-per- share dividend in addition to share repurchases. Both were roughly the same as the 23 cents-per-share dividend and previous $90 billion share repurchase increase the company announced a year ago.

Berkshire owns just under 6% of Apple.</p> <div></div> <p>The rapid growth has positioned the largest US public company as a fixture in Berkshire Hathaway&#039;s annual shareholder letters and Buffett&#039;s comments during annual meetings.</p> <p>At Berkshire&#039;s annual shareholders meeting on Saturday, investors will eagerly await what Buffett might say about his largest holding and its new forays into, , and </p> <p>The meeting also comes less than 48 hours after Apple&#039;s earnings report published late Thursday, which showed better than expected iPhone sales despite a 3% revenue decline year-over-year.</p> <p>Year-to-date, shares of the iPhone maker are up nearly 30%.</p> <div> <div> <div></div> </div> </div> The four &#039;jewels&#039; <p>In 2020, Buffett highlighted the Apple investment as one of the company’s four \"jewels,\" along with Berkshire&#039;s insurance operations led by Ajit Jain, Berkshire&#039;s ownership of railroad BNSF, and its Berkshire Hathaway Energy subsidiary.</p> <p>From shareholder returns to its brand recognition to its management team, Apple fits the bill for a Buffett bet.</p> <p>Buffett has long been a believer in the benefits of share buybacks and highlighted outsized dividend payments Berkshire receives from some long-time holdings like Coca-Cola (KO) and American Express (AXP) in this year&#039;s letter to shareholders.</p> <p>\"Our cost for that stake was $36 billion,\" Buffett wrote in his 2020 annual shareholder letter about the company&#039;s investment in Apple. \"Since then, we have both enjoyed regular dividends, averaging about $775 million annually, and have also — in 2020 — pocketed an additional $11 billion by selling a small portion of our position.</p> <div> Story continues </div> <p>\"Despite that sale — voila! — Berkshire now owns 5.4% of Apple. That increase was costless to us, coming about because Apple has continuously repurchased its shares, thereby substantially shrinking the number it now has outstanding.\" Today, Berkshire owns about 5.8% of the company.</p> <div> <div> <div>     </div> <div> <div> This content is not available due to your privacy preferences. </div>Update your settings here to see it. </div> </div> </div> <p>The Oracle of Omaha, however, was patient in entering the fray on his Apple position.</p> <p>Berkshire didn&#039;t place its bets on the company after the success of Apple&#039;s iPod launch in 2001 or its iPhone launch six years later. Instead, Buffett&#039;s ride with Apple has been fueled largely by growth in the company&#039;s services business.</p> <p>In 2015, Apple reported annual services revenue of $19.9 billion and wearable revenue of $10.1 billion.</p> <p>In 2022, those categories produced $78.1 billion and $41.2 billion, respectively.</p> <p>\"I just think of basically the utility of those products to a ecosystem that is demographically terrific and finds that instrument useful dozens and dozens of times a day,\" Buffett told Yahoo Finance in 2020. \"It&#039;s almost indispensable, not only to individuals, business, I mean, everything.\"</p> <p>More recently, Apple launched its high-yield savings account with Goldman Sachs, and at an event in September 2022 the company stressed its ambitions to integrate more deeply with healthcare tools.</p> <p>And when it comes to management, Buffett has rarely been lacking for praise of Apple CEO Tim Cook.</p> <p>\"Tim Cook, Apple’s brilliant CEO, quite properly regards users of Apple products as his first love, but all of his other constituencies benefit from Tim’s managerial touch as well,\" Buffett wrote in Berkshire&#039;s 2021 letter to shareholders.</p> <p>Adding at the 2021 annual shareholders meeting: \"Tim Cook was underappreciated for a while. He&#039;s one of the best managers in the world. And I&#039;ve seen a lot of managers. And he&#039;s got a product that people absolutely love.

AAPL reported second-quarter results that exceeded expectations Thursday, in line with the positive earnings trend seen so far in the big tech space. The outperformance came as iPhone revenue exceeded expectations and the Services revenue climbed to a new record. </p><p>Apple&#039;s Key Q2 Numbers: Cupertino, California-based Apple reported earnings per share of $1.52, exceeding the consensus estimate of $1.43 per share.</p><p>The bottom line was flat with the year-ago period and down 19.2% from the previous quarter&#039;s $1.88 per share.</p><div><div></div></div><div></div><p>Revenue came in $94.8 billion versus the Street forecast of $92.96 million. This marks a 3% year-over-year decline and 19.1% sequential drop.</p><p>It should be noted the second quarter is one of Apple&#039;s seasonally slow periods, coming right after the holiday shopping season. </p><p>Analysts, including Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring and Wedbush&#039;s Daniel Ives, were bracing for in-line March quarter results.</p><div><div><div></div></div></div><div>  </div><p></p><p>“We are pleased to report an all-time record in Services and a March quarter record for iPhone despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, and to have our installed base of active devices reach an all-time high,\" said Tim Cook, Apple&#039;s CEO. </p><p>The gross margin came in at 44.26% versus 43.75% in the second quarter of 2022 and 42.96% in the first quarter of 2023.</p><p>Apple’s Shareholder Returns: The company announced a $90-billion incremental buyback authorization and a 4% year-over-year increase in dividends to 24 cents per share.</p><p>\"Our year-over-year business performance improved compared to the December quarter, and we generated strong operating cash flow of $28.6 billion while returning over $23 billion to shareholders during the quarter,\" said Luca Maestri, Apple&#039;s CFO. </p><p>See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Apple Stock</p><p>Apple’s Business Segments: Among products, iPhone revenue came in at $51.33 billion, ahead of the $50.3 billion Morgan Stanley’s Woodring estimated. The analyst estimated shipments at 54.5 million and ASPs at $922 due to a strong high-end mix. iPhone revenue grew 1.5% year-over-year.</p><p>Mac revenue slumped over 31% to $7.17 billion. Woodring recently trimmed his Mac shipment forecast from 4.8 million units to 4.3 million units, consequently taking down the product’s revenue estimate by 10% to $6.3 billion.</p><p>iPad revenue fell 12.8%, while Services revenue rose 5.5% to a record $20.91 billion.</p><p>Deepwater Asset Management&#039;s Gene Munster said investors are also likely to focus on the active installed base, which rose 8% year-over-year to over 2 billion in the first quarter.</p><p>\"A growing base means the Apple product flywheel is working,\" he added.</p><p>Why June Quarter Could Be Soft: Apple could shed light on June quarter performance on the earnings call scheduled for 5 p.m. EDT.</p><p>Morgan Stanley&#039;s Woodring expects June quarter revenue of $80.3 billion, marking a 3% year-over-year decrease. This is below the consensus estimate of $84.71 billion.</p><p>The firm&#039;s expectation is premised on 41 million units of iPhone shipments, a $901 ASP and lower Mac, iPad and Services revenue. The variance of June quarter revenue vis-à-vis the consensus is primarily due to the softer iPhone revenue forecast of $37.2 billion.</p><p>Build strength in April and May could weaken as the trough of the iPhone 14 cycle approaches.</p><p>Morgan Stanley expects a better-than-consensus gross margin forecast for the quarter due to more favorable forex comparisons and further operational expenditure discipline.</p><p>AAPL Price Action: Apple shares have gained 27.8% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 Index, which added 5,8% during the same period.</p><p>Ahead of the quarterly results, Woodring said a March quarter beat and June quarter guide down have not historically produced a negative post-earnings stock reaction. Investors typically look past the trough of the cycle to the upcoming iPhone launch.</p><p>Munster said Apple&#039;s investment case will likely shift to a consumer staples company that should yield a higher multiple. \"On top of that, Apple is making meaningful progress in AI, a dynamic that is under-appreciated by investors,\" he added.</p><p>The average analyst price target for Apple stock, according to TipRanks, is $177.23, suggesting a roughly 6% upside from current levels.</p><p>After closing Thursday’s regular session down nearly a percentage point at $165.79, the stock is up 0.62% in after-hours trading, according to Benzinga Pro data.</p><p>Read Next: </p><p>Photo via Shutterstock.</p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></p>"

        "title": "Markets Down 4 Straight Sessions: Earnings from AAPL, EXPE, SQ & More",
        "content": "<p>On the first full day of trading with a Fed funds rate average more than 5% for the first time in over 15 years, we began the day in the red and stayed there through the closing bell, for the fourth-straight down-day in the market indices. The Dow sheathed another -283 points, -0.85% — making it the second of the major indices to trade in negative territory (behind the small-cap Russell 2000) year to date — while the S&amp;P 500 was -0.71%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq outperformed the field (and still up +15% year to date), down only -0.49%, while the Russell came in worst of all, -1.19%. Further spread of destabilization in West Coast regional banks continues, with PacWest PACW apparently the next domino to fall following First Republic’s collapse earlier this week — or at least that’s what market participants are expressing. PACW has fallen a bracing -50% in today’s session alone, -66% for the past month and -86% year to date. Thus far, the Fed has not treated this regional bank issue as terribly important — if it did, we probably wouldn’t have seen another interest rate hike yesterday. Meanwhile, after today’s close, we see a full parade of consumer-facing quarterly earnings results — and this is the part of the economy continuing to show resiliency. Don’t take my word for it, though. See with your own eyes: The world’s largest gadget maker, Apple Inc. AAPL, recorded beats for both earnings in its fiscal Q2 — $1.52 per share versus $1.44 anticipated — and quarterly sales — $94.84 billion versus $93.32 billion expected. The iPhone alone brought in $51.33 billion for the three months reported, +1.5%, while the Mac and iPad continued to slow down: -31% and -13%, respectively. Services came in more than +5% higher year over year to $20.91 billion, but were still slightly below expectations. Gross Margins of 44.3% were moderately better than the estimated 44.1%, as demand strength continues forward. Apple sees strength in China and especially India, where the company is reportedly expanding production. The company is also instituting a $90 billion share buyback and a dividend increase of 4% to 24 cents per share. Shares have gained +1.4% on the news in the after-market. Expedia EXPE actually missed expectations on both top and bottom lines — negative earnings of -20 cents per share missed the $0.00 expected on $2.67 billion in sales, which was marginally shy of the Zacks consensus $2.69 billion. But the company sees Gross Bookings up +20%, and the company is buying back $600 million in shares, which has helped send EXPE stock +1.5% in late trading. Expedia-competitor Booking.com BKNG shares are on an opposing track: the company beat estimates on both top and bottom lines, but shares are down in the after-market: earnings of $11.16 per share were above the $10.62 expected, on $3.78 billion which took out the $3.74 billion consensus. Gross Travel Bookings continued their strong trajectory from Q4, +44% year over year. But shares are giving back around -3% of the +28% growth in the stock, year to date. DoorDash DASH shares have been ping-ponging on the news of its Q1 report, posting a better-than-expected loss of -41 cents per share from the -56 projected, on $2.04 billion in revenues which outpaced the $1.92 billion expected, +40% year over year. Gross Order Volume grew +29% year over year, with Total Orders +27% — another company holding onto its strength from the previous quarter. Shares have moved from -7% after the release to +4% at this hour. Lyft LYFT is not so lucky at this hour — even on both top- and bottom-line beats in Q1: a positive +$0.07 per share versus an expected -$0.09 on $1.00 billion in sales which surpassed the $976.9 million anticipated, shares are tumbling -13% in late trading. Revenue guidance for Q2 is lighter than initial expected in our Zacks consensus, with adjusted EBITDA guidance notably lower than previously thought. Coinbase COIN is seeing a big pop in the after-market: +6% on much-better-than-expected results in Q1: a loss per share of -34 cents is much better than the forecast -$1.44, and $773 million in quarterly revenues easily outpaced the $652.8 million consensus. Cost-cutting and a jump in subscriber revenue assisted Coinbase’s healthy quarter, although the company projects lower subscriber growth for the ongoing quarter. Finally, Block SQ — cash payment platform and parent of Cash App, formerly known as Square Inc. — decisively outperformed expectations on both top and bottom lines after today’s close: earnings of 40 cents per share bettered the 31 cents predicted, while revenues of $4.99 billion swept past the $4.58 billion analysts were looking for. Full-year guidance is also improved, as customer engagement remains strong. Shares are +3.5% in late trading at this hour. Questions or comments about this article and/or its author?

        "content": "<p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div><p>Apple, Inc. AAPL reported forecast-beating results for the fiscal year second quarter, thanks to stronger-than-expected iPhone sales and record Services segment revenue.</p><p>Following the earnings release, CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri delved into the results and outlook and fielded analysts&#039; questions on the earnings call.</p><p>Here are the key takeaways:</p><div><div></div></div><div></div><p>Emerging Market Shines: Performance in emerging markets from South Asia to India to Latin America to the Middle East was strong, Maestri said on the call. The \"rest of the Asia-Pacific\" region saw 15.3% year-over-year revenue growth, outperforming the rest of the geographies.</p><p>Worldwide iPhone revenue rose 2% year-over-year to $51.3 billion, a March quarter record, due to March quarter record performance in several developed and emerging markets such as India, Indonesia, Turkey and the UAE.</p><p>Despite the currency headwinds, the quarter was a great one for emerging markets, CEO Cook said. \"We’re putting efforts in a number of these markets and really see, particularly given our low share and the dynamics of the demographics etc., a great opportunity for us and in those markets,\" he added.</p><div><div><div></div></div></div><div>  </div><p></p><p>India At Tipping Point: While noting that India saw double-digit year-over-year growth, Cook said the country is an incredibly exciting market. \"There are a lot of people coming into the middle class and I really feel that India is at a tipping point,\" he said.</p><p>See Also: Best Technology Stocks Right Now</p><p>Forex Remains A Headwind: The March quarter saw a 500-basis-point forex headwind, Cook said. This along with macroeconomic challenges led to the 3% year-over-year revenue drop. On a constant currency basis, revenue was higher year-over-year.</p><p>Record Installed Base: Installed base of active devices grew to a new record, thanks to a higher level of customer satisfaction and loyalty.</p><p>Mac, iPad Softness – Function Of Tough Comps: Cook said Mac and iPad revenues were in line with expectations. The year-over-year drop for both categories was due to a tough comparison with a year ago, which saw Apple roll out M1 chips throughout the Mac lineup and M1-powered iPad Air. iPad revenue also took a hit from forex headwinds and macroeconomic challenges.</p><p>Services – Crowning Glory: Services revenue came in at an all-time high of $20.9 billion, with record performances across App Store, Apple Music, iCloud and payment services. The business has now more than 975 million paid subscriptions, up 150 million over the past year. The company noted record Services revenue in the Greater China region that comprises mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. The rest of the geographies saw a March quarter record.</p><p>Services Boost Gross Margin: The 130 basis-point gross margin expansion from the previous quarter was due to a favorable mix shift towards services partially offset by leverage. The product gross margin fell 30 basis points sequentially to 36.7%, while the Services margin rose 20 basis points to 71%.</p><p>Macro Hurts Wearables, Home &amp; Accessories: Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $8.8 billion, down 1% year over year, with the macroeconomic environment serving as a drag. The U.S. and Greater China, however, saw record March performance for the segment. The Apple Watch installed base set a new all-time record.</p><p>June quarter Outlook: Maestri guided year-over-year June quarter revenue performance to be similar to that of the March quarter. This translates to revenue of $80.51 billion, below the consensus estimate of $84.71 billion. The company expects nearly 400 basis points of negative forex impact for the June quarter.</p><p>The company expects the Services business to see the same growth as in the March quarter.</p><p>Gross margin is expected at 44-44.5%.</p><p>AI Focus: On AI, Cook said it is very important to be deliberate and thoughtful in how one approaches these things and that there are a number of issues that need to be sorted.</p><p>The Apple CEO, however, conceded that the potential is certainly very interesting. The company has made enormous progress integrating AI machine learning throughout its ecosystem, weaving it into products and features for many years, he said.</p><p>\"We view AI as huge and you know we’ll continue weaving it in our products on a very thoughtful basis,\" he added.</p><p>Green Initiatives: Apple&#039;s manufacturing partners support over 13 gigawatts of renewable energy, translating to 17.4 million metric tons of avoided carbon emissions, equivalent to removing nearly 3.8 million cars from the road. The company is investing an additional $200 million in restore fund meant to support scalable nature-based carbon removal projects.</p><p>Price Action: In after-hours trading on Thursday, Apple stock rose 2.18% to $169.40, according to Benzinga Pro data.</p><p>Read Next: </p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></p>"

        "title": "Apple stakes future growth on emerging markets, starting with India",
        "content": "<p>By Stephen Nellis May 5 (Reuters) - When Apple Inc AAPL.O surprised investors this week with a rise in iPhone sales despite a slump in the global smartphone market, Chief Executive Tim Cook credited emerging markets like India where the company is luring away Android phone users. Cook is betting that those markets will provide more opportunities for growth, with their youthful populations and relatively few iPhones. Apple said iPhone sales rose 1.5% to $51.3 billion for its fiscal second quarter even as global smartphone shipments fell 13% in January to March, according to research firm Canalys, whose data showed Apple gained market share from Android phones. Apple said it set sales records in several countries across South Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. \"We&#039;re putting efforts in a number of these markets and really see, particularly given our low share and the dynamics of the demographics, a great opportunity for us in those markets,\" Cook told investors during a conference call. India is perhaps Apple&#039;s biggest focus. The company recently opened its first two retail stores there, in Mumbai and Delhi, and while Apple does not disclose revenue for the country, Cook told investors that it set a quarterly record and percentage growth was in very strong double digits year-over-year. \"There are a lot of people coming into the middle class, and I really feel that India is at a tipping point, and it&#039;s great to be there,\" Cook said on the conference call. Apple was the second biggest revenue generating brand in India in 2022, second only to Samsung as it gained 18% of the total value of smartphone shipments, according to research firm Counterpoint. For Apple, selling an iPhone in an emerging market represents more than just the sale of one device - it represents the chance to get consumers hooked on Apple devices and services over time. Customers who start with an iPhone might later add an Apple Watch or AirPods or sign up for subscription services. Cook said he saw opportunities for Apple in India in services but said that average revenue per user - a metric known as ARPU in the subscription business - would take time to catch up to Apple&#039;s other markets. USED IPHONE BOOM Part of the reason that Apple has been able to gain market share in both emerging and developed markets is the emergence of a booming market for used iPhones. Sales of refurbished iPhones rose 16% in volume globally during 2022. India led the growth with a 19% jump, according to Counterpoint, with iPhones accounting for 11% of secondary smartphone sales in India. In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, Apple&#039;s Cook said little of Apple&#039;s direct iPhone revenue comes from refurbished devices. However he said the company has tried to bolster the used iPhone market by offering trade-in deals on its iPhones and building them sturdy enough to last several owners. \"We encourage the market and it provides us an opportunity to hit some price points that we would not otherwise play in,\" Cook said in the interview.

After declining 8% in the December quarter due to production disruptions in China, iPhone revenue increased 1.5% year-over-year to $51.3 billion in the March quarter.</p> iPhone Sales Rebound in March Quarter <p>It’s worth noting that iPhone sales increased in the March quarter despite a 15% decline in global smartphone shipments, as per IDC estimates. </p> <p>During the Q2 earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook said, “The iPhone 14 and 14 plus continue to delight users with their long lasting battery and advanced camera.” Further, CFO Luca Maestri highlighted that the latest survey of U.S. consumers by 451 Research revealed 99% customer satisfaction for the iPhone 14 family.</p> <p>Additionally, iPhone’s active installed base rose to a “new all-time high,” with growth experienced across all geographic segments. The company boasts an iPhone base of “well over” $1 billion active devices, reflecting customer satisfaction and growing loyalty. </p> <p>In particular, iPhone witnessed solid demand in several developed and emerging markets in South Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. March quarter iPhone sales doubled on a year-over-year basis in India, Indonesia, Turkey, and the UAE.</p> <p>CEO Cook opened two retail stores in India in April and said that the company intends to expand its operations in the country. Cook stated that he was delighted to see the enthusiasm for the Apple brand in India. “There are a lot of people coming into the middle class, and I really feel that India is at a tipping point, and it’s great to be there,” he added.</p> <p>While iPhone sales improved and surpassed analysts’ estimate of $48.8 billion in the fiscal second quarter, the company’s overall sales declined 2.5% to $94.8 billion due to lower iPad and Mac sales amid macro challenges and currency headwinds.</p> Is Apple a Good Stock to Buy? <p>Following the results on Thursday, Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng reiterated a Buy rating on AAPL stock and raised the price target to $209 from $200. The analyst believes that given Apple’s low iPhone market share in developing markets (for instance, 3% in India and less than 1% in Indonesia), the company’s success in these markets could drive its revenue and installed base growth in the years ahead.</p> <p>The analyst is also upbeat about Apple’s Services business and sees it as a “reliable source” of long-term growth. Further, he noted that the company’s “generous” shareholder capital return program continues to drive the stock. </p> <p>Overall, Wall Street’s Strong Buy consensus rating for Apple is based on 21 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell. The average price target of $176.05 suggests 6.2% upside. .</p>  <p id=\"p_9e29f401b8945f7ef3bb0b5791ec57bd\" class=\"img_p\" ><img src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Apple.png\" id=\"9e29f401b8945f7ef3bb0b5791ec57bd\" onerror=\"javascript: this.parentNode.style.display='none'; \" /></p><p></p>  <p></p>  </div> </div></p>"

Foxconn said revenue last month reached T$429.2 billion ($14 billion), in line with the company&#039;s own expectations. For smart consumer electronics products, which include smartphones and are the company&#039;s main business driver, revenue in April declined as it entered the \"traditional slow season\", the company said in a statement, without elaborating. Business in the second quarter is expected to decline due to a high base last year and \"the seasonal off-peak period\" amid a transition between old and new products, it said. The first half of the year is traditionally slower for Taiwan tech manufacturers as major electronics vendors including Apple AAPL.O launch new products near the year-end holiday season. Apple results for the quarter ended April 1 beat expectations on Thursday, thanks to better-than-expected iPhone sales and inroads in India and other newer markets. Foxconn will report first quarter earnings on May 11 when it will also give an update on its outlook for the full year. The company in March predicted revenue for the full year to be flat, with weak demand for consumer electronics offset by growth in computing, cloud, networking and component products. Foxconn shares have risen 5.1% so far this year, lagging the broader Taiwan market .TWII, which is up 10.5%.

        "content": "<p>By Shubham Batra May 5 (Reuters) - European shares rose on Friday, as the European Central Bank&#039;s smaller rate hike, and market-beating results from Adidas and Apple boosted sentiment. The pan-European STOXX 600 index .STOXX edged up 0.1%, but is on track for its second consecutive weekly loss. Energy .SXEP and utilities shares .SXPP led the gains on the index, rising 1.4% and 1.0% respectively, while food and beverage shares .SX3P slid 0.4%. Air France-KLM SA AIRF.PA lost 2.8% despite better-than-expected first-quarter revenue and robust cash flow as it benefited from a global recovery in air travel. The ECB raised its benchmark rates by 25 basis points to 3.25%, the smallest increase in its rate-hike cycle that started last summer, but signalled more tightening was to come. French ECB policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau said earlier in the day that the ECB will continue increasing interest rates until inflation is under control. \"Inflation pressures worldwide help in driving equity markets although we don&#039;t like to pay higher prices, as consumers it eats into our pockets. The higher prices go to some company reaping the rewards of those higher prices,\" said Chi Chan, Portfolio Manager and Senior Research Analyst, Federated Hermes. \"As long as you&#039;re a company that is able to pass through inflation or higher, then you&#039;re a beneficiary and we do see that in the latest earnings.\" ECB&#039;s Survey of Professional Forecasters showed on Friday that euro zone inflation could be lower in the coming years than previously expected but may stay above ECB&#039;s 2% target further out. Among stocks, the biggest gainer on the index, Adidas AG ADSGn.DE climbed 7.1% after reporting better-than-expected first-quarter results, with investors hoping the German sportswear giant can turn its fortunes around. Caixabank SA CABK.MC rose 1.2% after the Spanish lender reported first quarter net profit above expectations and raised its 2023 lending income guidance. Meanwhile, shares of Evotec SE EVTG.DE lost the most on the index, dropping 9.0% after the company announced that it will leave German index MDAX .MDAXI. In the U.S., Apple Inc AAPL.O, the world&#039;s largest company by market capitalisation, surprised investors with a rise in iPhone sales even as the global smartphone market slumps. Investors will keep a close eye on the euro zone&#039;s retail sales data due at 0900 GMT to assess the economic strength of the region.

It is a good measure of overall market sentiment, and if it starts to lose support it will be a signal that the market mood is shifting and concern is growing about the economy.</p> <div></div> <p>Regional banks are seeing a rebound this morning. There has been talk that many names have been manipulated lower by aggressive shorting, but there obviously are substantial issues in the sector, where there may be at least $500 billion in unrealized losses due to the sharp increase in interest rates over the past year. I expect to see bargain hunters sift through the wreckage for names that have been unfairly included in the sector selloff, but there is real liquidation taking place and a rebound may take time.</p> <div></div> <p>At 8.30 am ET, the April jobs news will be reported. It is expected that nonfarm payrolls will drop to around 180,000 from 236,000 in March and that the unemployment rate will tick higher to 3.6% from 3.5%. What is most important about this report is the response will indicate the degree to which market concerns shift from inflation to economic growth. We will see if a soft report is good news because it is disinflationary or if it is bad news because it is recessionary.</p> <div></div> <p>After the Fed interest rate decision this past week, the market is data-depended because the Fed said that it is data-dependent.

        "content": "<p><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div> <p>I&#039;ll be the first to say it today: Anyone who claims to have extra insight on Apple (AAPL) is playing you.</p> <div></div> <p>Every firm on and off Wall Street has an analyst dedicated to Apple. They are poring through Thursday&#039;s earnings report twice over. I think they need to find the good in the report and push it down investors&#039; throats because Apple is one of the few pieces of the market foundation that&#039;s offering hope.</p> <div></div> <p>Headlines likely will focus on a net income beat, or earnings-per-share beat. Some may want to talk about record iPhone sales, which, admittedly, is impressive, especially after the recent Qualcomm (QCOM) report.</p> <div></div> <p>I&#039;m struggling with the fact that quarterly revenue was down 3% year over year and EPS would have been down as well had it not been for the insane amount of stock repurchased over the past year. Apple bought back $90 billion of its stock last quarter alone. Management did set revenue expectations for the current quarter well above current market estimates, so that should be seen as a positive.</p> <div></div> <p>Did Apple do enough to save the market? I don&#039;t think so, but it looks like it did enough to save itself</p> <div></div> <p>Apple likely will be our guide. If the stock goes green to red, using last night&#039;s after-hours action as the green, then the only position I&#039;d consider into the afternoon or even over the weekend is some limited short exposure or put action on pretty much the index of your choice.</p> <div></div> <p>I likely would look at a mix of the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) and the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) or possibly use the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) rather than the SPY.</p> <div></div> <p>My inkling would be to use the SPY if it is under the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA). It closed right on the 50-day EMA yesterday. A break could send us down to the 200-day EMA, currently around $399, before we find any stability.</p> <div></div> <p><p id=\"p_9327c852995189c303a1353fd3457162\" class=\"img_p\" ><img src=\"//s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/e5567656-eb3b-11ed-9f06-e96389030b16.png\" id=\"9327c852995189c303a1353fd3457162\" onerror=\"javascript: this.parentNode.style.display='none'; \" /></p><p></p> </p> <div></div> <p>Any close under the 200-day EMA for the SPY could get ugly. Bad things happen under the 200-day moving average. I&#039;m not calling for a crash, but it&#039;s fair to say crashes don&#039;t happen from a position of strength; they occur in weakness. Trading below the 50-day and 200-day EMA is a position of weakness.</p> <div></div> <p>If Apple can close the week strong, it should carry the QQQ back above short-term EMAs. While I&#039;m not looking long for a quick flip, if I move in that direction, my eyes will be focused on QQQ or AAPL itself. The relatively strong price action is too important to ignore. This still isn&#039;t a market to buy weakness or call bottoms, so if you want to be long, keep a focus on these or stocks reacting well to their own earnings report.</p> <div></div> <div></div> </div></p>"

The manufacturing plant for Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision (OTCPK:HNHPF), in Zhengzhou, China, is now said to be operating at roughly 90% of its capacity levels and has roughly 200,000 workers. According to Bloomberg, the Zhengzhou plant is now at roughly normal staffing levels and has bounced back in rapid fashion. On December 29, it was reported that the Zhengzhou plant was operating at 70%, indicating that Foxconn has been able to boost employment at the plant, sometimes known as \"iPhone city.\" Foxconn dealt with worker unrest last month as a result of COVID-19 restrictions placed on it by Chinese government officials and unpaid bonuses. Foxconn ended the \"closed-loop\" system that had been in place at its Zhengzhou plant and apologized for the unpaid bonuses. On Monday, Reuters reported that the plant hit 90% of its original target. Last month, J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee wrote that iPhone supply was \"improving and inching slowly toward parity with demand.\" Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida during his trip to Japan in December and .\n\n---\n\n[2023-01-03] 2023-01-02 23:47:00\n标题: Foxconn's Largest iPhone Plant In China Nears Resuming 100% Production\n内容: Apple Inc&#039;s AAPL crucial supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd HNHPF Foxconn Technology Group, has brought the largest iPhone plant to about 90% of anticipated peak capacity. The update implied Apple&#039;s biggest production partner had secured enough workers despite a Covid resurgence and recent staff uproar, Bloomberg reports. Foxconn doled out bonuses to attract new workers and convince those still there to stay on. Foxconn reportedly aimed for the plant to resume total production around late December to early January while also remaining cautious regarding the pandemic resurgence, Reuters reports. Foxconn&#039;s plant in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou operated with 200,000 staff, or about the average staffing level, a local daily reported, citing Foxconn executive Vic Wang. As of December 30, the plant shipped at 90% of the peak capacity forecast at the start of last year. Foxconn&#039;s speedy bounce-back bodes well for the production of Apple&#039;s marquee product as it gears up for the Lunar New Year shopping season. A nationwide Covid flare-up after Beijing abruptly dropped most Covid Zero-era curbs had clouded the prospects for manufacturers like Foxconn, which required armies of workers to keep factories buzzing. The recent outburst followed weeks of turmoil at the Zhengzhou plant known as iPhone City, which produces the vast majority of high-end iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max devices. The phenomenal disruption, in turn, fueled concerns about iPhone . Price Action: AAPL shares closed higher by 0.25% at $129.93 on Friday.\n\n---\n\n[2023-01-03] 2023-01-02 23:51:00\n标题: Shopify Could Emerge As Another Benefactor Of Apple's Privacy Concerns: FT\n内容: Shopify Inc SHOP aimed to fill a promising gap in marketing data left by Apple Inc’s AAPL privacy crackdown. Shopify offered retailers a new way to target potential customers through prominent ad platforms, Financial Times reports. Harley Finkelstein, Shopify’s president, told FT that after collaborating with Meta Platforms Inc META and Alphabet Inc GOOG GOOGL Google in 2022, its “Audiences” marketing tool was a key area of focus. Also Read: Shopify Impresses Most Analysts With Black Friday Sales The shift of focus came when the e-commerce industry slowdown forced Shopify to a cutback on other parts of its business. The new tool allows retailers to pool customer data and upload it to Meta and Google’s advertising platforms. Marketers can then target ads at “lookalike” customers more likely to buy their products because they purchased similar items from another retailer. The system aimed to bypass Apple’s rules against tracking iPhone users, which put a multibillion-dollar dent in the online ad industry last year and contend with Amazon.com Inc’s AMZN fast-growing ads business. Shopify Audiences could offer a much-needed growth opportunity when threatening recession and cash-strapped consumers squeezed retailers. “Especially right now, merchants want to be able to find more customers,” Finkelstein added. Finkelstein said Shopify prioritized initiatives with a “much shorter-term payback,” including expanding its business lending arm, Capital, to new regions and its fulfillment network, backed by its $2.1 billion acquisition of Deliverr. Price Action: SHOP closed lower by 1.08% at $34.72 on Friday.\n\n---\n\n[2023-01-03] 2023-01-03 00:24:08\n标题: Iridium smartphone contract signed, $20M revenue estimate could be conservative\n内容: imaginima/iStock via Getty Images Iridium (NASDAQ:IRDM) disclosed on Friday that it had signed a deal with an undisclosed partner to provide satellite service for smartphones and investment firm William Blair believes its estimate of $20M in annual recurring revenue could prove conservative. Analyst Louie DiPalma, who has an outperform rating on Iridium (IRDM), believes shares could move towards a range of $56 to $69 over the next 12 months, based in part on this deal, as well as its free cash flow projections. \"All signs continue to point to the highly anticipated deal being a major partnership with Samsung (Guardian of the Galaxy [S23]?) that may be formally unveiled in the first week of February,\" DiPalma wrote in a note to clients. \"We do not believe it is too late for investors to buy Iridium shares, despite the strong run-up in 2022.\" Iridium (IRDM) shares were fractionally higher in premarket trading on Tuesday to $51.45. DiPalma added that Iridium (IRDM) likely looked at GlobalStar&#039;s (GSAT) deal with Apple (AAPL) to provide emergency satellite service for its iPhone 14 product line as leverage in its deal, widely believed to be with Samsung (). The analyst added that as part of the Iridium (IRDM) deal, it will be paid development feeds, royalties and network usage fees, depending on successful development of the technology. \"We view the decision by Iridium’s board of directors to initiate a dividend in early December as a sign that the smartphone technology works and that the contract is lucrative,\" DiPalma added. He also noted that with this deal, it&#039;s possible that Iridium (IRDM) connectivity becomes a \"mainstay\" in high-end Samsung () smartphones over the next decade, given that it ships more than 250M phones every year. DiPalma also noted that the deal could transform Iridium (IRDM) from a niche provider to a mass market communications provider. Last month, Iridium (IRDM) declared its 13-cent-per share quarterly dividend, .\n\n---\n\n[2023-01-03] 2023-01-03 01:23:18\n标题: Apple App Store sees growth in December, first time since June (AAPL)\n内容: Wachiwit Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) saw net revenue growth for its App Store in December, its first growth since June, implying that there could be \"upside\" in its services segment, Morgan Stanley said on Tuesday. Analyst Erik Woodring, who has an overweight rating and a $175 price target on Apple (AAPL), noted that net revenue grew 1% year-over-year, citing data from Sensor Tower. That would imply a 2 point improvement from November. Delving deeper, Woodring noted that net revenue growth improved in 8 of Apple&#039;s (AAPL) 10 largest markets, including China, where it rose 2 points to see 2% year-over-year growth; Japan, which rose 1 point to -19% year-over-year growth; and the U.S., which was unchanged at 7% year-over-year growth. Growth in gaming largely led the way, with Woodring stating that recent approval in gaming licenses by the Chinese government was partially responsible for the uptick in growth, as were easier comparisons. \"With results from the month of December now finalized, we estimate December quarter App Store net revenue reached $6.3B,\" Woodring wrote in the note to clients. Assuming no other changes, Woodring estimated that Apple&#039;s (AAPL) Services revenue likely rose 6.7% year-over-year to $20.8B in the quarter, near the consensus estimate of $20.9B and above Morgan Stanley&#039;s own estimate. Going forward, Woodring added that Apple (AAPL) should see net revenue growth accelerate in each quarter of fiscal 2023 as year-over-year comparisons ease up, spending trends normalize and the company benefits from price hikes in international markets. \"While App Store growth remains near its lowest levels in history, and we acknowledge the global consumer remains challenged, we are encouraged to see growth trajectory continue to improve after bottoming in September,\" Woodring added. Apple (AAPL) shares rose nearly 1% in premarket trading on Tuesday. Separately on Tuesday, it was reported that Apple (AAPL) and its manufacturing partner are getting closer to operating .\n\n---\n\n[2023-01-03] 2023-01-03 01:25:00\n标题: Apple may be cutting MacBook, Apple Watch production levels (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n内容: Shahid Jamil The new year has just started, and already questions are arising over how Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is doing with regards to rolling new products off the proverbial assembly line. Like many big-name tech companies, Apple (AAPL) spent much of 2022 dealing with supply issues involving its manufacturing partners in China. And Apple&#039;s (AAPL) main maker of the iPhone, Foxconn, was reportedly close to having 90% of its production capacity back in operation for the iPhone 14 line of smartphones. The move would go a long way toward calming concerns about Apple&#039;s (AAPL) production levels coming out of the Christmas and holiday shopping season. However, while iPhone production levels may be stabilizing, there are new reports that Apple (AAPL) has told its manufacturing partners to slow down on building several of the companies other products. According to the Nikkei Asia, Apple (AAPL) has informed many of its suppliers to build fewer components for its MacBook computers, Air Pods and the Apple Watch for the first quarter of the year.

In March, the tech giant will charge $89.In this articleAAPLCustomer inspects iPhone 14 Pro Max inside an Apple store in Marunouchi, Tokyo.Stanislav Kogiku | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesOut-of-warranty iPhone owners will soon have to spend more to replace their batteries at an Apple store, Apple said this week.Starting on March 1, all older iPhones that came out before 2022 will see their battery replacement fees increase by $20, the tech giant said on its website. Currently, the owner of an iPhone 13 will pay $69 for a new battery. In two months, Apple will charge $89.Battery price increases will also apply to older iPhones, some iPads, MacBook laptops and in some international markets as well.Currently, all iPhone 14 models are under warranty, and if something goes wrong the company will fix the phone for free. But when they start to emerge from warranty on the one-year anniversary of purchase, Apple will charge $99 to replace the batteries in them.The move shows that Apple is still adjusting prices in response to higher costs for labor and parts. Although inflation has recently slowed in the U.S., the company said last year that inflation had affected its business, and it raised iPhone prices in several international markets.The change could also prompt more people to upgrade their phones to a new model instead of replacing the battery. It could also drive users to non-Apple repair stores for lower prices.Changes in the battery replacement fee have affected iPhone sales in the past.In late 2017, users discovered that Apple had added some software code that slowed down iPhones with older batteries that had been mostly used up, to prevent the whole iPhone from unexpectedly shutting down because of the weak battery.The revelation became a scandal for Apple, forcing the company to respond to Congress and pay international fines. Its solution to customers at the time was to offer battery replacements for $29, versus the older price of $79. The battery replacements were massively popular and lots of iPhone owners opted for the cheap tuneup, straining Apple&#039;s retail stores before the program ended and prices rose again.In 2019, Apple CEO Tim Cook pointed to the $29 battery replacements as one reason for lower-than-expected iPhone sales at the time in .TVListen\n\n---\n\n[2023-01-03] 2023-01-03 04:00:00\n标题: Microsoft recognizes its first union as ZeniMax software testers organize\n内容: Key PointsMicrosoft recognized the union of quality-assurance testers across ZeniMax Media in the U.S.In 2021 Microsoft acquired ZeniMax Media, which publishes Fallout and The Elder Scrolls, for over $8 billion.Employees in three parts of game publisher Activision Blizzard have unionized, but Microsoft hasn&#039;t finished acquiring it.In this articleMSFTLisbon , Portugal - 3 November 2022; Brad Smith, Vice Chair and President, Microsoft, at a press conference during day two of Web Summit 2022 at the Altice Arena in Lisbon, Portugal.

Last year, Microsoft said it would support approaches that would make it simpler for its employees to join unions. In recent months three groups of employees at video game publisher Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft is working to acquire, have unionized, but Microsoft has yet to complete the nearly $69 billion deal that competition regulators have pushed back on. Last week, the Communications Workers of America said a supermajority of employees at Proletariat, a Boston-based game studio Activision Blizzard acquired in mid-2022, had voted to unionize.Now U.S. quality-assurance employees across multiple studios at ZeniMax, a video game publisher Microsoft bought in 2021 for $8.1 billion, are organizing with the CWA, which has also worked with the Activision Blizzard workers. ZeniMax publishes \"Doom,\" \"Fallout,\" \"Quake\" and \"The Elder Scrolls,\" among other games.\"In light of the results of the recent unionization vote, we recognize the Communications Workers of America (CWA) as the bargaining representative for the Quality Assurance employees at ZeniMax,\" a spokesperson for Microsoft and ZeniMax wrote in an email to CNBC. \"We look forward to engaging in good-faith negotiations as we work towards a collective bargaining agreement.\"A supermajority of ZeniMax workers said they wanted to join the union, the CWA said in a statement.

Nvidia (NVDA) said the cloud gaming service, which has more than 1,000 titles to play, including The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Cyberpunk 2077, would be available for certain cars made by the Hyundai Motor Group, including Hyundai, Kia and Genesis brands. The streaming service is also coming to Chinese automaker BYD and Polestar (PSNYW), the Jensen Huang-led Nvidia (NVDA) announced. In a separate GeForce NOW-related move, Nvidia (NVDA) said it would bring its RTX 4080 GPU to the high-end version of the service. In addition, NVIDIA announced a strategic deal with Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai, to develop automated and autonomous vehicle platforms. Nvidia (NVDA) also took the wraps off GeForce RTX 40 Series laptops and said it had partnered with Mercedes to modernize the automaker&#039;s factories. However, Nvidia&#039;s (NVDA) decline also highlighted a rocky start to the 2023 trading year as the downtrend seen in 2022 amid recession worries, rising inflation and interest rates continued to weigh on the chip sector. Nvidia (NVDA) competitor Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which was highlighted by several investment firms for 2023, including Bernstein, fell 1.2%.

If the stock closes at or below $125.72, Apple’s AAPL, -3.92% valuation would fall below the $2 trillion threshold. Shares were trading below that point in intraday action Tuesday, at levels that imply a $1.983 trillion valuation. Apple hasn’t closed with a valuation south of $2 trillion since March 8, 2021, according to Dow Jones Market Data, and its stock price hasn’t implied an intraday valuation below that level since March 30, 2021. The slide in Apple shares over the past year is on pace to shave about $1 trillion from the company’s peak closing market capitalization. The smartphone giant peaked with a closing valuation of $2.986 trillion exactly a year ago, on Jan. 3, 2022. More recently, the company has been dogged by questions about the impact of manufacturing issues in China, where COVID-19 curbs forced production disruptions late last year. While the company is typically thought to have durable demand on the assumption that customers will delay purchases or put up with long delivery times in order to obtain desired Apple products, some analysts have questioned whether Apple will be able to make up for all of its lost demand in future quarters. A Nikkei Asia report from earlier this week hinted at demand challenges. The report, which cited anonymous sources, said that Apple has told some of its suppliers to make fewer components for AirPods, Apple Watches and MacBook computers in the first quarter. Apple didn’t immediately respond to a MarketWatch request for comment.

In McTernan&#039;s weekly report during the NFL season, the analyst tracked game results and their potential impact on the coverage and Apple Inc AAPL iOS app rankings for OSB operators in the sports category. Week 17 results of the five largest spreads likely indicate a negative hold for sportsbook operators, with favorites winning in all the five most giant spread games. This continues a difficult stretch for the OSB operators, as, during the last seven weeks in the five most extensive spread matchups per week, the favorite has won 34 of 35 games. In the iOS app rankings, FanDuel held an edge over DKNG for the top spot on average for the fifth straight week. Elsewhere in the rankings, the OSB apps McTernan track all saw a boost this week. BetMGM averaged the #7 spot in the iOS app rankings, their first time in the top 10, and Barstool averaged the #12 spot, the first time they&#039;ve been ranked in the top 15. The analyst believes the operators benefited from the OSB launch in Ohio on Jan 1. McTernan sees DKNG as a leader in the emerging North American online gambling market, a $35 billion market opportunity. Within this market, the analyst believes DKNG has a sustainable customer acquisition strategy that should continue to drive its first- or second-place position in all states. McTernan expects margins to scale with the tech stack transition to SBTech from Kambi, national vs. local marketing benefits, and reaching terminal market access penetration.

Michael Nagle/Bloomberg PayPal Holdings and Block got knocked down in 2022 as investors factored in a challenging economy, but two Wall Street analysts see better times ahead. After sticking to a Neutral rating on Block (ticker: SQ) for two years, Baird’s David Koning upgraded his rating to Outperform on Tuesday. Truist’s Andrew Jeffrey, who maintained a Hold rating on PayPal (PYPL) for almost as long, moved to a Buy. The analysts predict gains of more than 20% for the fintech stocks. Shares of Block and PayPal fell 61% and 62%, respectively in 2022 versus the S&amp;P 500 ‘s 19% slide as investors soured on growth-oriented names amid fears of a possible recession. Sentiment could improve in 2023, according to Baird, while both analysts cited the companies’ holdings of cash as a positive factor. “We think the Street has adequately penalized the stock in 2022,” Koning said of Block. “We like the stock now.” Koning’s reasoning partly rests on Block’s cash balance, reported as $4.6 billion in the November filing for the third quarter. Assuming a 2% average lift in interest rates in 2023, this alone could add $160 million in pretax income, or about 20 cents in earnings per share, he said.The Baird analyst raised his price target on Block to $78 from $62, implying a gain of roughly 20% from its current level of about $64. Truist’s Jeffrey had stuck with a Hold rating on PayPal because “our long-held view is that consensus [on long-term organic revenue growth] has been too aggressive,” considering the payments company’s market-share losses to Apple Pay, Amazon Pay, and Google Pay, he said. But now expectations have been reset amid the market-share loss. Truist expects PayPal’s revenue to increase 10.3% in calendar 2023. The consensus call among analysts tracked by FactSet is now for 9.2% growth, compared with 15.1% at the end of 2021. Jeffrey also pointed to PayPal’s net cash position of more than $6 billion, as reported in the company’s third-quarter filing, which creates flexibility to buy back shares or acquire companies. The two analysts’ calls add to the already bullish view on the Street. According to FactSet, more than 70% of all analysts tracking Block and PayPal rate the companies as Outperform or Buy, according to the latest figures on FactSet. “The Street loves a comeback story,” said Koning. “Particularly one that’s a premier large cap growth franchise.” Write to Karishma Vanjani at .\n\n---\n\n[2023-01-03] 2023-01-03 06:00:00\n标题: What 15 Analyst Ratings Have To Say About Apple\n内容: Analysts have provided the following ratings for Apple AAPL within the last quarter: Bullish Somewhat Bullish Indifferent Somewhat Bearish Bearish Total Ratings 3 7 5 0 0 Last 30D 0 0 1 0 0 1M Ago 0 1 0 0 0 2M Ago 1 1 2 0 0 3M Ago 2 5 2 0 0 These 15 analysts have an average price target of $171.13 versus the current price of Apple at $124.575, implying upside.Below is a summary of how these 15 analysts rated Apple over the past 3 months.

Truist’s Andrew Jeffrey, who maintained a Hold rating on PayPal (PYPL) for almost as long, moved to a Buy.

Sentiment could improve in 2023, according to Baird, while both analysts cited the companies’ holdings of cash as a positive factor.</p> <p>“We think the Street has adequately penalized the stock in 2022,” Koning said of Block. “We like the stock now.”</p> <p>Koning’s reasoning partly rests on Block’s cash balance, reported as $4.6 billion in the November filing for the third quarter. Assuming a 2% average lift in interest rates in 2023, this alone could add $160 million in pretax income, or about 20 cents in earnings per share, he said.</p><p></p><p>The Baird analyst raised his price target on Block to $78 from $62, implying a gain of roughly 20% from its current level of about $64. </p> <p>Truist’s Jeffrey had stuck with a Hold rating on PayPal because “our long-held view is that consensus [on long-term organic revenue growth] has been too aggressive,” considering the payments company’s market-share losses to Apple Pay, Amazon Pay, and Google Pay, he said. </p> <p>But now expectations have been reset amid the market-share loss. Truist expects PayPal’s revenue to increase 10.3% in calendar 2023.

A small number of retailers -- think Costco (NASDAQ: COST) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) -- manage to build up durable competitive advantages over the course of decades. Most retailers aren&#039;t so lucky. Right now, many retail stocks look surprisingly cheap based on trailing earnings. Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (NYSE: BBY) goes for around 13 times earnings, department store Macy&#039;s (NYSE: M) trades for less than 5 times earnings, and grocery chain Kroger (NYSE: KR) changes hands for roughly 14 times earnings. Those are not particularly optimistic valuation multiples. Valuation has its limits With persistently high inflation and rising interest rates pressuring consumer spending, retailers in general are likely in for a rough and unpredictable 2023. Even the strongest retailers are starting to face headwinds. Walmart (NYSE: WMT), for example, suffered a gross margin decline in the third quarter of 2022 and guided for a drop in adjusted earnings for the full fiscal year. Many retailers will see their margins contract this year as consumers pull back on spending. While Macy&#039;s stock may look extremely inexpensive, for example, it&#039;s probably not as cheap as it looks. Analysts are expecting a modest decline in earnings for the company in the upcoming fiscal year, but that could turn out to be far too optimistic. It&#039;s a similar story with Best Buy. Despite tumbling demand for PCs and smartphones, analysts still expect a small increase in Best Buy&#039;s earnings per share in the upcoming fiscal year. Color me skeptical. Deciding whether or not to invest in a retailer based on past earnings is problematic for two reasons. First, because the past is the past, and second, because the past few years have been pretty weird. An unprecedented shutdown of the economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 was followed by a period of booming demand and free-flowing stimulus. None of that was normal, so basing investment decisions on a retailer&#039;s results during that time doesn&#039;t make a ton of sense. Basing investment decisions on analyst estimates for future earnings is problematic because analysts are often wrong, and sometimes very wrong. Analyst estimates can be useful, but they certainly shouldn&#039;t form the foundation of anyone&#039;s investing process. The most important question When I consider investing in a retailer, I naturally take into account valuation, earnings, and growth. But the most important question I ask is this: If the retailer disappeared from the face of the Earth tomorrow, would consumers really care? Amazon: Yes, consumers would definitely care. There are plenty of e-commerce alternatives, but none of them have anywhere close to the product selection of Amazon. People order from Amazon because it&#039;s easy, and no other retailer has replicated that. Costco: Yes. While whether shopping at Costco actually saves you money depends on how prone you are to impulse purchases and overspending, consumers certainly believe that the company saves them money. Costco&#039;s membership renewal rates are above 90%. Best Buy: I&#039;d say yes, but not nearly as strongly compared Amazon or Costco. Best Buy has transformed itself over the past decade partly by putting a renewed focus on customer service. That&#039;s the company&#039;s big differentiator, and it&#039;s the reason why the retailer holds a somewhat unique place in the U.S. retail market. Macy&#039;s: No. There&#039;s nothing special about Macy&#039;s. There are surely some loyal customers out there, but that&#039;s true of every retailer. Macy&#039;s finds itself operating in a portion of the department store industry that has little reason to exist. It&#039;s not focused on low prices and value like Kohl&#039;s or even Target, and it doesn&#039;t have the cachet of a higher-end department store like Nordstrom. Kroger: The grocery business has become concentrated among a small number of megachains, so for that reason, consumers would probably care. But in the grocery industry, I like specialized chains like Sprouts that people shop at for reasons other than it being the closest store to their homes. None of this is to say that the best retailers on this list will definitely be great investments, or that the worst retailers on this list will definitely be duds. But if you want the odds to be in your favor, stick with retailers that have some sort of edge, and that customers genuinely like. 10 stocks we like better than Macy&#039;s When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This brings Amazon’s total portfolio to more than 20 GW—that could generate the amount of energy to power 5.3 million U.S. homes—across 401 renewable energy projects in 22 countries. The company’s renewable energy purchases continue to add new wind and solar projects on the grids that power Amazon’s operations, including Amazon Web Services (AWS) data centers, Amazon fulfillment centers, and physical stores around the world. With these continued investments, Amazon set a new corporate record for the most renewable energy announced by a single company in one year. The company remains the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy—a position it’s held since 2020, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Amazon’s continued investment in renewable energy helps to accelerate growth in new regions through innovative deal structures, technologies, and cloud solutions. These purchases also bring Amazon closer to powering its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025—five years ahead of its original 2030 target. In 2022, the company announced new projects in Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Poland, Singapore, Spain, and the U.S., and broke ground in Brazil, India, and Indonesia. With 25 new renewable energy projects secured to close out the year, the company now has 401 projects globally, including 164 wind farms and solar farms, and 237 rooftop solar projects on Amazon facilities. Once operational, Amazon’s global renewable energy projects are expected to generate 56,881 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of clean energy each year. “As we continue to launch new renewable energy projects around the world, we’re pleased to be on track to power our operations with 100% renewable energy, five years ahead of our original target. With 133 projects in 11 countries announced in 2022, Amazon had another record year,” said Adam Selipsky, CEO of AWS. “These projects highlight the diversity of our renewable energy sources and showcase our ability to bring new technologies to new markets and further reduce the impacts of climate change.” In addition to the 108 clean energy projects the company announced in 2022, Amazon today is announcing 25 additional 2022 clean energy projects. These include: Eleven new projects in Europe, including Finland, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, totaling 372 megawatts (MW) of capacity. Tapping into one of the world’s best renewable energy resources, Amazon continued to add to its portfolio of offshore wind projects, investing in two new offshore wind projects in Europe totaling 280 MW of capacity. Four new projects in North America, totaling 918 MW of energy in Arizona, California, and Texas. A new solar project paired with energy storage in California allows Amazon to store clean energy produced by its solar projects and deploy it when solar energy is not available, such as in the evening hours, or during periods of high demand. Also in California, Amazon added its first on-site solar project at the Amazon Air Hub, where employees pack and handle freight and conduct planeside operations. Ten new renewable energy projects in India, Indonesia, and Japan. In India, a third 200 MW wind-solar hybrid project was added to Amazon’s first two wind-solar hybrid projects. Renewable hybrid energy systems can play a key role in helping India accelerate the decarbonization of power generation, lowering the cost of electricity in the medium term. These hybrid energy systems also maximize clean energy use on the grid by combining two technologies with different generation profiles, reducing variability in renewable generation, and improving grid stability. In Indonesia, Amazon invested in its first renewable energy projects, securing a first-of-its-kind agreement for corporations to access additional utility-scale solar projects. In Japan, Amazon added three on-site solar projects and a new 38 MW utility-scale solar project. Rapidly scaling renewable energy is one of the most effective strategies to fight climate change. To ensure organizations’ renewable energy purchases have the greatest impact on emissions reductions, Amazon recently led the creation of the new Emissions First coalition. This coalition is leading advocacy efforts to modernize the world’s leading carbon-accounting standard, helping to reduce carbon from global electricity grids as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. \"Amazon&#039;s clean energy portfolio doesn&#039;t just top the corporate charts—it is now among the leading utilities globally, as well,” said Kyle Harrison, head of sustainability research at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. “The fact that it announced a new annual record of clean energy in a year mired by a global energy crisis, supply chain bottlenecks and high interest rates speaks to its forward planning and expertise in navigating power markets and executing long-term contracts.\" “Amidst the market uncertainty of 2022, Amazon led clean energy buyers and doubled down on its commitment to renewable energy,” said Miranda Ballentine, CEO of Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA). “Amazon’s commitment to decarbonization is demonstrated through its leading placement on CEBA’s Deal Tracker Top 10, within our member community, and on a global scale.” “As Asia continues to transition away from coal and gas, these investments by Amazon in wind and solar are further evidence that there is a large and growing corporate renewable electricity demand in this region. We look forward to continuing to work with Amazon and our other ACEC members to rapidly increase the supply of renewables and to achieve our shared 100% renewable ambitions in the region,” said Sam Kimmins, director of energy at Climate Group and Asia Clean Energy Coalition (ACEC) spokesperson. Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge in 2019, committing to reach net-zero carbon by 2040—10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. The Pledge now has nearly 400 signatories, including Best Buy, IBM, Microsoft, PepsiCo, Siemens, Unilever, Verizon, and Visa. Amazon continues to transform its transportation network, including electrifying its delivery fleet and sourcing alternatives to fossil fuels—it currently has thousands of electric delivery vehicles from Rivian in more than 100 cities and regions in the U.S., more than 3,000 electric vans delivering packages to customers in Europe, and several electric vehicle partnerships in APAC. The company is also investing $2 billion in the development of decarbonizing services and solutions through The Climate Pledge Fund.

Zurich will use AWS’s reliable global infrastructure, advanced analytics, and machine learning technologies to deliver new digital customer experiences and drive automation at scale, in support of its worldwide digital strategy. As part of the multiyear strategic collaboration, Zurich will move 1,000 applications to AWS by 2025, including core insurance and SAP workloads. Zurich will move its critical applications to AWS, simplifying, modernizing, and automating the company’s infrastructure. This approach will provide flexible and scalable application environments, enabling agile product development. Using Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon Aurora (AWS’s fully managed MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database built for the cloud), and AWS App Runner (AWS’s service to quickly deploy containerized web applications and APIs), Zurich will develop and bring new products to market quicker, saving approximately $30 million a year. As a result, Zurich can focus on innovation and new customer experiences, reinvesting valuable resources into new business opportunities, recruitment, and acquisition strategies. By embracing cloud technologies, Zurich will also be able to streamline and optimize its core business processes and better prepare for new reporting requirements in 2023, including alignment with international financial reporting standards—IFRS 9 and IFRS 17. Zurich will use RISE with SAP on AWS, a fully managed offering that combines SAP’s solution and implementation experience with AWS&#039; experience in helping customers transform their SAP landscapes on the cloud. By migrating its SAP environment to AWS, Zurich will create a modern, cloud-based system connecting data across its entire business. The SAP workloads migration will consist of 20 landscapes, a collection of servers for a specific workload, including more than 100 individual systems such as human resources (HR) and finance. AWS’s extensive SAP experience will allow Zurich to increase the performance of its SAP applications and integrate its data with advanced analytics and machine learning services to gain predictive capabilities and enterprise-wide reporting. Zurich works with AWS Skills Guild, a comprehensive skills enablement program that helps organizations accelerate cloud outcomes by creating excitement, increasing employee engagement, and nurturing a culture of learning. The insurance provider has already trained more than 400 employees, with plans to further grow the program. Zurich offers skills development opportunities to help attract and train new employee talent, and accelerate cloud adoption across the company. “We want to help our retail customers lead safer and healthier lives, and bring our business customers peace of mind, by using the power of digital technologies to meet their evolving needs,” said Zurich’s Ericson Chan, Group Chief Information and Digital Officer. “Working with AWS will transform the way we bring solutions to market and enable us to make the most accurate and up-to-date insights available to our customers. We look forward to using the new AWS Region in Switzerland to support our regulatory reporting requirements.” “Zurich’s focus on customers and innovation over the last 150 years is why it remains a leading insurer for more than 55 million people and businesses around the world. Moving their most critical business applications to AWS allows Zurich to put data at the heart of its business to automate processes, increase efficiency, and improve customer responsiveness,” said Matt Garman, senior vice president of Sales, Marketing, and Global Services at Amazon Web Services. “Combining Zurich’s financial expertise with AWS’s broad functionality will help the insurer continue to evolve its business to anticipate customer needs, and provide more personalized insurance products.” About Amazon Web Services Since 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud.

I discuss two key levels that investors should watch as Amazon gets ready for its Q4 earnings presentation. HJBC I am very bullish with respect to the upcoming earnings presentation of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Amazon will report its 4Q-22 earnings on Thursday, February 2, 2023, and I believe the eCommerce company has a good chance of exceeding low profit expectations. I also believe that the outlook for 1Q-23 could be better than expected, and that too much negativity is currently priced into Amazon's valuation.

Read full disclaimer. Our pick: Which powerline network adapter is best? Powerline adapters are like the best Wi-Fi extenders in that they’re all nearly identical in design and boring as stale toast. But if we must spotlight one specific adapter, TP-Link’s TL-PA9020P kit is a solid choice with its dual Gigabit Ethernet ports and capacity for Multi-Gig speeds using your home’s electrical wiring.

Read full disclaimer. What should you look for in a powerline adapter? Speed should be your top priority. Electrical wiring is unshielded, so there can be a lot of interference slowing down the connection between adapters. Get a powerline kit with a high transmission rate if you can—you’ll probably see a quarter of that speed at the most, so the higher, the better. You should also consider adapters with pass-through electrical sockets so you don’t lose an outlet when you plug an adaptor into the wall. The sockets are filtered too, meaning your connected device won’t add more electrical noise than what you already have plaguing your home’s wiring. Best overall—TP-Link TL-PA9020P Best overall View on Amazon *Amazon.com Price (as of 1/18/23 09:06 MST). Read full disclaimer. We like that both adapters in the TL-PA9020P kit have dual Gigabit Ethernet ports, especially on the router end, since you lose a LAN port to the adapter. The kit has a great max transmission rate too, but your top speed depends on your home’s wiring and everything connected to it. Theoretically, the kit has a range of up to 984 feet, but your walls and ceilings can hide a lot of length, so the practical distance may be shorter than you think. You can pair up to 16 adapters within that range if you need to expand your connections. Pros: Dual Gigabit Ethernet ports Pass-through outlet Cons: No Wi-Fi connectivity Side-mounter LEDs Best for budgets—TP-Link TL-PA7017P Best for budgets View on Amazon *Amazon.com Price (as of 1/18/23 09:06 MST). Read full disclaimer. This powerline adapter kit is a watered-down version of the TP-Link TL-PA9020P kit listed above. It has half the transmission rate and half the Gigabit Ethernet ports for about half the cost. It should be plenty if you need a smidge more speed in areas where Wi-Fi can’t reach. Like with the TL-PA9020P kit, you can create a single TL-PA7017P powerline network with up to 16 nodes—you can even mix and match compatible TP-Link HomePlug AV2 powerline adapters. Also, the built-in pass-through socket is filtered, so no worries about adding extra electrical noise that can disrupt your powerline network. Pros: Great price Pass-through outlet Cons: Lackluster speed No Wi-Fi connectivity Best for speed—Zyxel PLA6456BB Best for speed View on Amazon *Amazon.com Price (as of 1/18/23 09:06 MST). Read full disclaimer. Zyxel’s powerline kit has the fastest transmission speeds on our list, thanks to its use of the newer Gigabit Home Networking (G.hn) standard, which theoretically enables speeds up to 2,400 Mbps. In real-world use cases, you may see 600 Mbps tops, and that’s the best you’ll probably get from networking across noisy power lines until the technology improves. Other callouts include its impressive range, easy plug-and-play setup, and included pass-through electrical socket, which prevents you from losing a power connection. The adapter’s power-saving feature claims to reduce power consumption by up to 90% by going into standby mode automatically when the adapter idles. Pros: Fast speeds Best range Cons: No Wi-Fi Lower node count Best for Wi-Fi—TP-Link TL-WPA7617 Best for Wi-Fi View on Amazon *Amazon.com Price (as of 1/18/23 09:06 MST). Read full disclaimer. We generally don’t like to suggest powerline kits with Wi-Fi because you’d probably be better off with a traditional Wi-Fi extender. But if you can’t or don’t want to use Ethernet or Wi-Fi to widen your home network, TP-Link’s TL-WPA7617 kit is here to help. At first glance, the adapter seems best for IoT devices because real-world powerline speeds are slow, and the Wi-Fi 5 standard is outdated. The big callout here is OneMesh compatibility and how the adapter chooses the best connection (Wi-Fi or powerline) to receive and send data to the router. To get the most out of this kit, you need a compatible TP-Link OneMesh router. Also, keep in mind that you’ll lose a wall plug since the Wi-Fi unit doesn’t have a pass-through socket (but the router-side unit does). Pros: AC1300 Wi-Fi access OneMesh support Cons: Single pass-thru socket High price Best nano kit—TRENDnet TPL-422E2K Best nano kit View on Amazon *Amazon.com Price (as of 1/18/23 09:06 MST). Read full disclaimer. If you don’t need pass-through sockets on your powerline adapters, TRENDnet’s TPL-422E2K starter kit should be ideal. It’s a bit more expensive than Zyxel’s kit, which packs more speed and longer range, but the compact design of each unit keeps them inconspicuous—great for offices. This kit’s theoretical speed is middling compared to other TP-Link kits. However, it supports only up to eight units in a single powerline network, where other powerline kits support up to 16. But theoretically, you could pair this kit with any other powerline adapter based on the HomePlug AV standard. Pros: Compact design Easy installation Cons: No Wi-Fi connectivity No pass-thru sockets Powerline network adapter specs and features All powerline adapters have the same mission: extend your home network using existing electrical wiring. As a result, they have nearly identical features across the board. Here are a few specifics to look for when shopping for a new kit. Speed The higher the transfer rate, the better. Electrical wiring wasn’t designed to deliver data, so there’s no shielding to reduce interference. If a powerline adapter has a theoretical transfer rate of 2,000 Mbps, you may see a quarter of that speed at most between two units. Your real-world speed depends on your electrical wiring, the power outlets, the devices you have plugged in, and the circuit breakers. Pass-through power outlet Get a powerline adapter with a pass-through socket if you’re in a space where power outlets are in high demand. These sockets let you keep the same number of working power outlets while maintaining your wired internet connections. Generally, these powerline adapters plug into the bottom socket on a wall outlet. But their size may prevent you from plugging a power connector with a ground prong (like desktop power cables) into the top socket. You should be fine with plugs without the third prong. Gigabit Ethernet All powerline adapters listed here have at least one Gigabit Ethernet port. In the typical scenario, you plug one adapter into a router and the other adapter into a wired device. You don’t want a Fast Ethernet port on an adapter, which has a max speed of 100 Mbps versus 1,000 Mbps with Gigabit Ethernet. Since you want the most out of your connection, Gigabit Ethernet is best. Shopping around for new internet? Enter your zip code below to see which providers are available in your area. Our verdict It’s hard to pick our favorite blade of grass, and that’s what it feels like while selecting the best powerline adapter. They all look identical and do the same thing. But TP-Link’s TL-PA9020P kit hits that “just right” sweet spot in our book. We like the extra Gigabit Ethernet port, especially on the router side, so you don’t lose a LAN port. The speed is decent, and the pass-through socket is a great extra. Get the TP-Link TL-PA9020P kit FAQ about powerline network adapters Who should use powerline networking? Use a powerline adapter if most of your home network works fine, but you need a more reliable, wired connection for one or two devices. For example, a powerline connection would be great for the PC in your basement that never gets a reliable Wi-Fi signal. However, powerline networking isn’t a replacement for wiring your home with Ethernet if you need a bunch of fast wired connections. Why don’t I see the advertised speeds? Your home’s electrical wiring isn’t designed to deliver data. The wires don’t have shielding to block all the electrical noise interfering with connections between adapters. Plus, your real-world speeds depend on how your home is wired (copper vs. aluminum), the electrical system’s age, wall outlet types, and installed circuit breakers. You may find that sticking with Wi-Fi 6 is a far better option than powerline. Check out our picks for the best Wi-Fi 6 routers you can get. What interferes with powerline transmissions? Anything that causes electrical noise reduces transmission speeds between powerline adapters. Here’s a list of examples: Appliances Power supplies (device chargers) Surge protectors Fluorescent lights Light dimmers How do I improve my powerline network’s performance? We put together a list of Dos and Don’ts so you can get the most out of your powerline network: Do Don’t Plug adapters directly into a wall socket Keep adapters on the same circuit Unplug nearby device chargers Keep adapters away from appliances Plug an adapter into a power strip Plug an adapter into a surge protector Plug an adapter into an extension cord Plug in an adapter near an appliance Plug an adapter into an AFCI outlet Plug an adapter into a GFCI outlet Share outlets with fluorescent lights HomePlug vs. G.hn: What’s the difference? Both are networking standards used to deliver data across a medium. The HomePlug standard primarily focuses on electrical wiring, whereas Gigabit Home Networking (G.hn) adds support for coax cable, telephone lines, and Ethernet cables. HomePlug AV2 was introduced in 2011 and is still widely used in powerline products, although the older HomePlug Alliance is now inactive. The G.hn Wave 2 standard—developed by the International Telecommunication Union—arrived in 2016 and is expected to be succeeded by Wave 3 in 2023. What does “use the same circuit” mean? Some homes may have more than one circuit breaker box. For example, there may be one feeding the main house and one feeding a garage turned into a three-room rental. Keep the powerline adapters connected to the same circuit breaker box. You may even see the best performance from adapters on the same circuit breaker.

Here's what investors need to know before the announcement. Analysts estimate that Amazon.com will report an earnings per share (EPS) of $0.19. Amazon.com bulls will hope to hear the company announce they've not only beaten that estimate, but also to provide positive guidance, or forecasted growth, for the next quarter. New investors should note that it is sometimes not an earnings beat or miss that most affects the price of a stock, but the guidance (or forecast).

The startup initially catapulted to mainstream attention after it showed up on the popular startup investing show “Shark Tank.” It originally was called Doorbot but rebranded to Ring shortly after its “Shark Tank” debut. The startup didn’t get an investment from any sharks, but it did manage to get acquired by Amazon.com Inc. AMZN for $1 billion. Since it’s been under the Amazon umbrella, Ring has released a number of new and innovative solutions. Recently, Ring released its new dashcam, which contains many of the same features as its doorbell. It’s also released several other products like smart lighting and door locks. What happened: Ring’s next-generation product, while still on-brand, is a bit less traditional. The company plans to release a mini security drone that can fly around your house. Users can program the drone to fly along custom paths to see what is happening around their house anytime from anywhere. If, for example, your front door alarm is triggered, the drone will undock and fly to the area to see what’s going on. Using the drone's built-in video camera, you can monitor anything that's happening from your phone. While the product won’t be available until at least 2024, this isn’t a vanity project or reach goal. The product is available for users by invitation. This shouldn’t be surprising because home security products are becoming incredibly advanced. MaxTracker, for example, is a startup integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into its security products. The startup creates small GPS trackers about the size of a thick credit card. The trackers have a battery life of up to a year and can use AI to distinguish between a bike being stolen versus getting knocked over or an older person falling down versus dropping their tracker. MaxTracker is raising funds to develop its products, meaning anyone can invest in the company for a limited time. Similarly, Amazon has been developing drone technology for years. It began testing Prime Air in 2013 but didn’t begin rolling out the program commercially until November. Amazon has had years of perfecting the technology, so it’s likely there will be further integrations of drone technology into the Amazon suite of products.\n\n---\n\n[2023-02-01] 2023-02-01 11:00:00\n标题: Dragon Glassware® releases Astronaut Glasses\n内容: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Feb. 1, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The twenty-first century space race is on and while NASA prepares its next moon landing and mission to Mars, Dragon Glassware is excited to cheer the NASA team on from the ground with the launch of their new Astronaut Glasses!

While that was true at the time of his death, he had been in office for under four months when he was shot. On July 2, 1881, President James Garfield was in a good mood. Having completed a few months in office, Gaffy, as at least one of his friends called him, was going on vacation. It was a welcome break from the presidency, which Garfield found tedious and depressing. After doing a handspring over a bed in the White House, the 49-year-old president headed to the Baltimore and Potomac railroad station. He was accompanied by Secretary of State James Blaine — and no security. While waiting for the train, he was suddenly shot twice and fell to the ground. Though he survived the initial incident, Garfield would ultimately succumb to his wounds a few months later. The killer, Charles Guiteau, was delusional and obsessive, a stalker who believed that murdering Garfield would save the Republican Party. He was also a former member of a New York utopian colony, the Oneida Community. WpGet the full experience.Choose your plan ArrowRight Like that once-famous colony, Garfield’s untimely death has been largely forgotten today, but both take on central roles in Susan Wels’s book “An Assassin in Utopia: The True Story of a Nineteenth-Century Sex Cult and a President’s Murder.” Wels has exhaustively researched the assassination and all the factors leading up to it, especially Guiteau’s association with Oneida. Packed with colorful characters and well-chosen details, this book is an engrossing — if at times too wide-ranging — account of Victorian-era American eccentricity. ‘Booth’ imagines the dysfunctional family that created John Wilkes Booth From the outside, the Oneida Community looked idyllic. Led by the preacher John Humphrey Noyes, it was the most successful utopian colony of the period, spanning more than 30 years. At its height, tourists flocked to what Wels describes as the “wild woodland” in Upstate New York, with orchards, livestock, “whizzing mills” and women with “queer cropped hair and shamelessly short skirts.” But behind the facade, Oneida’s free-love philosophies descended into pedophilia, incest and experiments in eugenics. The colony’s bizarre sexual beliefs naturally make for some of the most interesting reading in the book, as Wels knows how to paint a picture without being salacious or distasteful. Guiteau, who joined Oneida at age 19, was no doubt attracted to the colony’s erotic reputation. Unfortunately for him, the women wanted nothing to do with him and mockingly called him “Git Out.” “Sexual frustration, in fact, was the main cause of Guiteau’s misery,” Wels writes, as he “whined about his lack of access to Oneida’s women.” Still, he believed he was a great man in the making, destined to be “famous in this world.” Advertisement His narcissistic aspirations contrast sharply with Garfield’s waning ambitions. As a senator, former Civil War general and family man, Garfield seemed, by middle age, to be content with his life. No one was more shocked than he was when he emerged from the Republican convention as the presidential nominee. Instead of touring the country, he campaigned from the front porch of his Ohio farm, attracting trainloads of visitors. He seemed dismayed when he won. “He had accidentally attained the presidency,” Wels writes, “without the fire and vision for it that drove other candidates.” Share this articleShare Wels has a knack for making connections between disparate facts and coincidences. A hearse “ominously trapped” in Garfield’s inauguration parade becomes, in her hands, sad foreshadowing. Ties to Oneida surrounded the presidency. Roscoe Conkling, Garfield’s biggest political enemy, was a former district attorney in Oneida County and called “the giant of Oneida.” Garfield’s predecessor, Rutherford B. Hayes, was Noyes’s cousin. (Strangely, Hayes’s contentious election, with voter suppression, fraud accusations and simmering violence, had eerie parallels to the 2020 election.) In another coincidence, Abraham Lincoln’s son Robert was at the train station and saw Garfield’s shooting. It was the second presidential assassination he witnessed, having been at his father’s side as he died in 1865. That year, when speaking on Lincoln’s death, Garfield had said he didn’t believe it was “in the American character to become assassins.” In Jon Meacham’s biography, Lincoln is a guiding light for our times At times, Wels seems too caught up in her own research. Large portions of the book cover figures like Margaret Fuller and P.T. Barnum who are only tangentially connected to the story. “An Assassin in Utopia” also touches on a cross-dressing female Civil War spy, the spiritualist Fox sisters, the New York cholera pandemic, the history of the graham cracker, and the beliefs and ill-fated political career of newspaper publisher Horace Greeley — just to name a few threads. Throughout, Guiteau lurks in the background, growing increasingly unhinged as he drifts from one scheme to the next. Unfortunately he’s too thin and uninteresting a character to absorb all the detours, so it’s easy to lose track of why you’re reading about, say, the origins of Greeley, Colo., a place where neither Garfield nor Guiteau set foot. The upside of this approach is that by the time I got to the assassination, I was thoroughly immersed in 1880s Washington, with its shabby White House engulfed in the “stench of sewage rising out of malarial mud flats” outside. The ending is a page turner as Wels describes Garfield’s last days alive, oblivious to Guiteau skulking in the shadows. I felt real sympathy for the charismatic, reluctant president. “An Assassin in Utopia” may not stay focused on the story its title promises, but it does succeed in humanizing Garfield and the tragedy of his early death. “I am bidding goodbye to the freedom of private life, and to a long series of happy years,” Garfield wrote at the beginning of his term, unaware of how true those words would turn out to be.

WpGet the full experience.Choose your plan ArrowRight With the publication of “Exiles,” Harper has completed the Falk trilogy, which began in 2017 with “The Dry.” In that novel we met Falk, then 36, working in the financial division of the Australian Federal Police. That makes sense, since Harper was coming to thriller-writing from a business reporting beat at the Herald Sun in Melbourne. Falk was back in “Force of Nature,” published in 2018. Harper then wrote a couple of books off-series — “The Lost Man” in particular built her audience in the United States. While it’s not critical to read the three Falk books in order, it greatly enhances the experience. “Exiles” is set six years after the events of “The Dry,” for instance, and revolves around a friendship established in the earlier book. “The Dry” was set in Kiewarra, a fictional farming community in regional Victoria, five hours from Melbourne. The title refers to the drought raging in the area, sucking the life out of the local economy, creating the imminent threat of wildfire and driving everyone a bit mad. The scorching heat and its effects are never off the page for very long; environment and weather are always key players in Harper’s work. Advertisement This area is where Falk grew up and where he returns in “The Dry” under grisly circumstances: His childhood best friend, Luke, has shot his wife and child and then himself, leaving their younger baby wailing in her crib. Or perhaps there’s some other explanation for the deaths. Falk’s homecoming is hardly a happy one, as he and his father were railroaded out of town when he was a teenager after the death of Falk’s girlfriend under mysterious circumstances. Harper established right away that Falk was no debonair James Bond type, but he is a thoughtful, compassionate man. (With the handsome, dark-eyed Australian actor Eric Bana playing Falk in the film version of “The Dry” and the forthcoming “Force of Nature,” the unprepossessing element of Falk’s persona doesn’t seem to have survived the transition to the screen.) He’s unmarried and a bit of a loner, though quite happy to fall into a friendship with Greg Raco, the personable local policeman on the case, and his pregnant wife, Rita. Raco is relatively new to the town, so he relies on Falk to clarify the knotted, nasty backstories and attitudes of the locals. Drought-related despair is running so high that many people seem to view Luke’s act with as much pity as blame. In “Force of Nature,” Harper sends Falk to the wild Giralang Mountains, another fictionalized but quintessentially Australian location. The crime in the past this time is a notorious set of serial killings in the mountains 20 years earlier. Though the killer died in jail, one victim’s body was never found, and his son may still be on the loose. Nonetheless, a Melbourne boutique accountancy firm has chosen the area for a team-building retreat. Falk and his new partner, Carmen, are already in touch with one of the women in the group, a whistleblower named Alice Russell who has documents that prove her bosses have been involved in money laundering for generations. The five women sent into the woods for the retreat come back late, drenched, bloody, snakebit and down one member — Alice has disappeared. “Force of Nature” ends with Falk phoning up Greg Raco to make a plan for a hike in the Giralang, and the friendship with Raco sets up the situation in “Exiles,” the new book, billed as the last of the series. In a prologue, Falk is on the way with Raco to a fictional part of South Australian wine country, the Marralee Valley, to stand as godfather at the christening of Raco and Rita’s second child, Henry. The baby Rita was pregnant with in “The Dry” is now 5, and though the family still lives in Kiewarra, Marralee is where Raco grew up and where his brother Charlie runs the family winery. The christening was to be held over the same weekend as the local wine and produce festival, a state-fair-type event that makes it a perfect time to visit the area. Advertisement But the first night of the fair, Charlie Raco’s ex-wife Kim, now remarried, parked her new baby’s pram under the Ferris wheel, then disappeared. The search consumed the next few days, and the christening was postponed. Share this articleShare Chapter 1 opens one year later. Kim was never found, though one of her white sneakers turned up stuck in the dam by the reservoir. Some people believe she may have taken her own life. One person who definitely doesn’t go for that theory is Zara, the 17-year-old daughter Kim had with Charlie. Zara’s made up a “Have you seen me?” flier to distribute at the fair. (Connoisseurs will note that there’s always a missing-person flier in an Aaron Falk mystery.) Others believe there may be some connection between a hit-and-run five years earlier, and though the local cop thinks they’re dreaming, Falk doesn’t rule it out. For the first time, Harper gives Falk a love interest: Gemma, the festival director, widowed five years earlier by that unsolved hit-and-run. She and Falk already know there’s a spark between them — they met in Melbourne a while back when both were supposed to see Raco for a drink and he never showed. Well, that was then, this is now. By the time of the christening, Falk has a brief fantasy that he and Gemma are in that church for another reason. Advertisement But what happened to Kim Gillespie? In such a tightknit community, how does a person just disappear? Though she makes a point of careful plotting and neatly tied-up threads, Harper’s books are as much about Australian society and the pressures and dangers of the country’s landscape as they are about finding missing people and solving murders. Social issues like domestic abuse, addiction and bullying play a significant role in her plots, and “Exiles” is no exception. The ability to spot subtle warning signs of a troubled soul is probably Falk’s greatest gift as an investigator, leading him to look for answers about Kim’s fate very close to home. Exiles By Jane Harper Flatiron. 368 pp. $27.99 A previous version of this story incorrectly said that Gemma, a character in “Exiles,” had been selected as Zoe’s godmother. It also misstated the character whose christening Aaron Falk was attending in that book. This story has been updated.

A source alerted The Post to the listing, first discovered by a Chinese-American teenager who was told to bring in a China-themed jersey for a school event. The student, whose family is from Hong Kong, shopped for the jersey on Amazon. The Post obtained a screenshot of the shopper’s Amazon results for “China flag jersey,” which displayed the bumper stick in the first row, among products that appeared unrelated to the search topic. When The Post searched Amazon’s marketplace for the phrase “China T-shirt,” the site displayed similar results, with the bumper sticker listed near the top of the page. After a review, Amazon said the bumper sticker was incorrectly included in the customer’s search results and has been removed from appearing in the query in the future. 3 Amazon said the bumper sticker was incorrectly listed in the search result. Amazon “Customer trust is a top priority, and we work to maintain that trust throughout the shopping experience,” Amazon spokesperson Alyssa Bronikowski said in a statement. “We continuously monitor our store and act quickly if we find or are alerted about an issue.” While Amazon has policies in place to govern potentially vulgar or offensive content, the definition of what constitutes a violation can be murky, according to James Thomson, a former Amazon insider who is a consultant to Amazon sellers. “It’s hard to define what the difference is between offensive and censorship,” Thomson said. “I think if Amazon found out this product is listed someone there might think, yeah, we shouldn’t have this…it’s a gray zone of what constitutes offensive material,” Thomson added. Thomson noted a search for the word “f–k” yields more than 8,000 results on Amazon. 3 The bumper also appeared in results for “China T-shirts.” Amazon Amazon detailed its approach to the sale of “controversial products and content” in a blog post updated last month. “Our offensive and controversial products policies prohibits the sale of products that promote, incite, or glorify hatred, violence, racial, sexual, or religious intolerance or promote organizations with such views, as well as listings that graphically portray violence or victims of violence,” the company said in the post. “We periodically review and update these policies based on experience, current events, and other relevant developments, and in consultation with internal and external resources,” the company added. The “F—k China” bumper sticker is offered by a California-based artist named Brian Bula, who sells an array of products with slogans catering to all sides of the political spectrum. Other bumper stickers in his Amazon store say “F—k Putin,” “F—K Joe Biden” and “Trump 20-24 Years In Prison.” 3 The product listing page for the bumper sticker. Amazon Bula’s website describes him as “politically independent with friends on the right and left.” When reached for comment, Bula noted that he also sells a “I Love China” button design — and has no control over where Amazon’s algorithm lists his products in search. “As I am sure you know, Amazon’s algorithms decide what products to show, and search results are personalized and impacted by prior searches and information Amazon collects on and off its marketplace,” Bula said. “Many of my products are political and me, and my products, are continually attacked by partisans with political motives – from both sides,” he added.\n\n---\n\n[2023-02-03] 2023-02-03 22:09:00\n标题: Why Amazon Stock Plunged Today\n内容: What happened Shares of Amazon.com (AMZN -2.99%) fell 8.4% on Friday after the online retail colossus warned of a downturn in its most profitable business. So what Amazon's net sales grew by 9% year over year to $149.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Gains in the e-commerce giant's North American segment more than offset declines in its international operations. Yet growth in the company's key Amazon Web Services (AWS) business slowed markedly. AWS's revenue rose 20% to $21.4 billion. That's down from 27% growth in the third quarter and 40% in the year-ago period. \"Starting back in the middle of the third quarter of 2022, we saw our year-over-year growth rates slow as enterprises of all sizes evaluated ways to optimize their cloud spending in response to the tough macroeconomic conditions,\" Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said during a conference call with analysts. \"As expected, these optimization efforts continued into the fourth quarter.\" To better withstand the downturn, Amazon is slashing expenses. The company said in January that it would reduce its workforce by more than 18,000 employees. Amazon also shuttered many of its brick-and-mortar stores and pared back the expansion of its massive e-commerce fulfillment network. Still, Amazon's operating income fell more than 20% to $2.7 billion. Severance costs and impairment charges contributed to the decline. Now what Olsavsky said Amazon would work with its cloud customers to help them reduce costs. \"As we look ahead, we expect these optimization efforts will continue to be a headwind to AWS growth in at least the next couple of quarters,\" Olsavsky said. \"So far in the first month of the year, AWS year-over-year revenue growth is in the mid-teens.\" With AWS's pace of expansion slowing, Amazon expects its revenue to grow by only 4% to 8% to between $121 billion and $126 billion in the first quarter of 2023. \"In the short term, we face an uncertain economy, but we remain quite optimistic about the long-term opportunities for Amazon,\" CEO Andy Jassy said.",

        "title": "Want to Invest in a Retail Stock? Ask This Question First.",
        "content": "<p>Retail is a tough business in any economic climate. A small number of retailers -- think Costco (NASDAQ: COST) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) -- manage to build up durable competitive advantages over the course of decades. Most retailers aren&#039;t so lucky. Right now, many retail stocks look surprisingly cheap based on trailing earnings. Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (NYSE: BBY) goes for around 13 times earnings, department store Macy&#039;s (NYSE: M) trades for less than 5 times earnings, and grocery chain Kroger (NYSE: KR) changes hands for roughly 14 times earnings. Those are not particularly optimistic valuation multiples. Valuation has its limits With persistently high inflation and rising interest rates pressuring consumer spending, retailers in general are likely in for a rough and unpredictable 2023. Even the strongest retailers are starting to face headwinds. Walmart (NYSE: WMT), for example, suffered a gross margin decline in the third quarter of 2022 and guided for a drop in adjusted earnings for the full fiscal year. Many retailers will see their margins contract this year as consumers pull back on spending. While Macy&#039;s stock may look extremely inexpensive, for example, it&#039;s probably not as cheap as it looks. Analysts are expecting a modest decline in earnings for the company in the upcoming fiscal year, but that could turn out to be far too optimistic. It&#039;s a similar story with Best Buy. Despite tumbling demand for PCs and smartphones, analysts still expect a small increase in Best Buy&#039;s earnings per share in the upcoming fiscal year. Color me skeptical. Deciding whether or not to invest in a retailer based on past earnings is problematic for two reasons. First, because the past is the past, and second, because the past few years have been pretty weird. An unprecedented shutdown of the economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 was followed by a period of booming demand and free-flowing stimulus. None of that was normal, so basing investment decisions on a retailer&#039;s results during that time doesn&#039;t make a ton of sense. Basing investment decisions on analyst estimates for future earnings is problematic because analysts are often wrong, and sometimes very wrong. Analyst estimates can be useful, but they certainly shouldn&#039;t form the foundation of anyone&#039;s investing process. The most important question When I consider investing in a retailer, I naturally take into account valuation, earnings, and growth. But the most important question I ask is this: If the retailer disappeared from the face of the Earth tomorrow, would consumers really care? Amazon: Yes, consumers would definitely care. There are plenty of e-commerce alternatives, but none of them have anywhere close to the product selection of Amazon. People order from Amazon because it&#039;s easy, and no other retailer has replicated that. Costco: Yes. While whether shopping at Costco actually saves you money depends on how prone you are to impulse purchases and overspending, consumers certainly believe that the company saves them money. Costco&#039;s membership renewal rates are above 90%. Best Buy: I&#039;d say yes, but not nearly as strongly compared Amazon or Costco. Best Buy has transformed itself over the past decade partly by putting a renewed focus on customer service. That&#039;s the company&#039;s big differentiator, and it&#039;s the reason why the retailer holds a somewhat unique place in the U.S. retail market. Macy&#039;s: No. There&#039;s nothing special about Macy&#039;s. There are surely some loyal customers out there, but that&#039;s true of every retailer. Macy&#039;s finds itself operating in a portion of the department store industry that has little reason to exist. It&#039;s not focused on low prices and value like Kohl&#039;s or even Target, and it doesn&#039;t have the cachet of a higher-end department store like Nordstrom. Kroger: The grocery business has become concentrated among a small number of megachains, so for that reason, consumers would probably care. But in the grocery industry, I like specialized chains like Sprouts that people shop at for reasons other than it being the closest store to their homes. None of this is to say that the best retailers on this list will definitely be great investments, or that the worst retailers on this list will definitely be duds. But if you want the odds to be in your favor, stick with retailers that have some sort of edge, and that customers genuinely like. 10 stocks we like better than Macy&#039;s When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "<p><div><p> The company’s renewable energy portfolio now totals more than 20 GW and will generate enough clean energy to power 5.3 million homes in the U.S.</p><p> Amazon’s renewable energy purchases last year brought it closer to powering its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025—five years ahead of its original target </p><p>SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced that in 2022 it grew its renewable energy capacity by 8.3 gigawatts (GW) through 133 new projects in 11 countries. This brings Amazon’s total portfolio to more than 20 GW—that could generate the amount of energy to power 5.3 million U.S. homes—across 401 renewable energy projects in 22 countries. The company’s renewable energy purchases continue to add new wind and solar projects on the grids that power Amazon’s operations, including Amazon Web Services (AWS) data centers, Amazon fulfillment centers, and physical stores around the world. </p><p> With these continued investments, Amazon set a new corporate record for the most renewable energy announced by a single company in one year. The company remains the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy—a position it’s held since 2020, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Amazon’s continued investment in renewable energy helps to accelerate growth in new regions through innovative deal structures, technologies, and cloud solutions. </p><p> These purchases also bring Amazon closer to powering its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025—five years ahead of its original 2030 target. In 2022, the company announced new projects in Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Poland, Singapore, Spain, and the U.S., and broke ground in Brazil, India, and Indonesia. With 25 new renewable energy projects secured to close out the year, the company now has 401 projects globally, including 164 wind farms and solar farms, and 237 rooftop solar projects on Amazon facilities. Once operational, Amazon’s global renewable energy projects are expected to generate 56,881 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of clean energy each year. </p><p> “As we continue to launch new renewable energy projects around the world, we’re pleased to be on track to power our operations with 100% renewable energy, five years ahead of our original target. With 133 projects in 11 countries announced in 2022, Amazon had another record year,” said Adam Selipsky, CEO of AWS. “These projects highlight the diversity of our renewable energy sources and showcase our ability to bring new technologies to new markets and further reduce the impacts of climate change.” </p><p> In addition to the 108 clean energy projects the company announced in 2022, Amazon today is announcing 25 additional 2022 clean energy projects. These include: </p><ul><li> Eleven new projects in Europe, including Finland, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, totaling 372 megawatts (MW) of capacity. Tapping into one of the world’s best renewable energy resources, Amazon continued to add to its portfolio of offshore wind projects, investing in two new offshore wind projects in Europe totaling 280 MW of capacity. </li><li> Four new projects in North America, totaling 918 MW of energy in Arizona, California, and Texas. A new solar project paired with energy storage in California allows Amazon to store clean energy produced by its solar projects and deploy it when solar energy is not available, such as in the evening hours, or during periods of high demand. Also in California, Amazon added its first on-site solar project at the Amazon Air Hub, where employees pack and handle freight and conduct planeside operations. </li><li> Ten new renewable energy projects in India, Indonesia, and Japan. In India, a third 200 MW wind-solar hybrid project was added to Amazon’s first two wind-solar hybrid projects. Renewable hybrid energy systems can play a key role in helping India accelerate the decarbonization of power generation, lowering the cost of electricity in the medium term. These hybrid energy systems also maximize clean energy use on the grid by combining two technologies with different generation profiles, reducing variability in renewable generation, and improving grid stability. In Indonesia, Amazon invested in its first renewable energy projects, securing a first-of-its-kind agreement for corporations to access additional utility-scale solar projects. In Japan, Amazon added three on-site solar projects and a new 38 MW utility-scale solar project. </li></ul><p> Rapidly scaling renewable energy is one of the most effective strategies to fight climate change. To ensure organizations’ renewable energy purchases have the greatest impact on emissions reductions, Amazon recently led the creation of the new Emissions First coalition. This coalition is leading advocacy efforts to modernize the world’s leading carbon-accounting standard, helping to reduce carbon from global electricity grids as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. </p><p> \"Amazon&#039;s clean energy portfolio doesn&#039;t just top the corporate charts—it is now among the leading utilities globally, as well,” said Kyle Harrison, head of sustainability research at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. “The fact that it announced a new annual record of clean energy in a year mired by a global energy crisis, supply chain bottlenecks and high interest rates speaks to its forward planning and expertise in navigating power markets and executing long-term contracts.\" </p><p> “Amidst the market uncertainty of 2022, Amazon led clean energy buyers and doubled down on its commitment to renewable energy,” said Miranda Ballentine, CEO of Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA). “Amazon’s commitment to decarbonization is demonstrated through its leading placement on CEBA’s Deal Tracker Top 10, within our member community, and on a global scale.” </p><p> “As Asia continues to transition away from coal and gas, these investments by Amazon in wind and solar are further evidence that there is a large and growing corporate renewable electricity demand in this region. We look forward to continuing to work with Amazon and our other ACEC members to rapidly increase the supply of renewables and to achieve our shared 100% renewable ambitions in the region,” said Sam Kimmins, director of energy at Climate Group and Asia Clean Energy Coalition (ACEC) spokesperson. </p><p> Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge in 2019, committing to reach net-zero carbon by 2040—10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. The Pledge now has nearly 400 signatories, including Best Buy, IBM, Microsoft, PepsiCo, Siemens, Unilever, Verizon, and Visa. Amazon continues to transform its transportation network, including electrifying its delivery fleet and sourcing alternatives to fossil fuels—it currently has thousands of electric delivery vehicles from Rivian in more than 100 cities and regions in the U.S., more than 3,000 electric vans delivering packages to customers in Europe, and several electric vehicle partnerships in APAC. The company is also investing $2 billion in the development of decarbonizing services and solutions through The Climate Pledge Fund.

        "content": "<p><div><p> With AWS as its preferred cloud provider, global insurance leader will use AWS capabilities and the AWS Europe (Zurich) Region to speed innovation and meet regulatory and security requirements </p><p>SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Amazon Web Services (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced that Zurich Insurance Group (Zurich), a leading multi-line insurer providing property, casualty, and life insurance solutions globally, is moving its enterprise information technology (IT) infrastructure to AWS. Zurich will use AWS’s reliable global infrastructure, advanced analytics, and machine learning technologies to deliver new digital customer experiences and drive automation at scale, in support of its worldwide digital strategy. As part of the multiyear strategic collaboration, Zurich will move 1,000 applications to AWS by 2025, including core insurance and SAP workloads. </p><p> Zurich will move its critical applications to AWS, simplifying, modernizing, and automating the company’s infrastructure. This approach will provide flexible and scalable application environments, enabling agile product development. Using Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon Aurora (AWS’s fully managed MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database built for the cloud), and AWS App Runner (AWS’s service to quickly deploy containerized web applications and APIs), Zurich will develop and bring new products to market quicker, saving approximately $30 million a year. As a result, Zurich can focus on innovation and new customer experiences, reinvesting valuable resources into new business opportunities, recruitment, and acquisition strategies. By embracing cloud technologies, Zurich will also be able to streamline and optimize its core business processes and better prepare for new reporting requirements in 2023, including alignment with international financial reporting standards—IFRS 9 and IFRS 17. </p><p> Zurich will use RISE with SAP on AWS, a fully managed offering that combines SAP’s solution and implementation experience with AWS&#039; experience in helping customers transform their SAP landscapes on the cloud. By migrating its SAP environment to AWS, Zurich will create a modern, cloud-based system connecting data across its entire business. The SAP workloads migration will consist of 20 landscapes, a collection of servers for a specific workload, including more than 100 individual systems such as human resources (HR) and finance. AWS’s extensive SAP experience will allow Zurich to increase the performance of its SAP applications and integrate its data with advanced analytics and machine learning services to gain predictive capabilities and enterprise-wide reporting. </p><p> Zurich works with AWS Skills Guild, a comprehensive skills enablement program that helps organizations accelerate cloud outcomes by creating excitement, increasing employee engagement, and nurturing a culture of learning. The insurance provider has already trained more than 400 employees, with plans to further grow the program. Zurich offers skills development opportunities to help attract and train new employee talent, and accelerate cloud adoption across the company. </p><p> “We want to help our retail customers lead safer and healthier lives, and bring our business customers peace of mind, by using the power of digital technologies to meet their evolving needs,” said Zurich’s Ericson Chan, Group Chief Information and Digital Officer. “Working with AWS will transform the way we bring solutions to market and enable us to make the most accurate and up-to-date insights available to our customers. We look forward to using the new AWS Region in Switzerland to support our regulatory reporting requirements.” </p><p> “Zurich’s focus on customers and innovation over the last 150 years is why it remains a leading insurer for more than 55 million people and businesses around the world. Moving their most critical business applications to AWS allows Zurich to put data at the heart of its business to automate processes, increase efficiency, and improve customer responsiveness,” said Matt Garman, senior vice president of Sales, Marketing, and Global Services at Amazon Web Services. “Combining Zurich’s financial expertise with AWS’s broad functionality will help the insurer continue to evolve its business to anticipate customer needs, and provide more personalized insurance products.” </p><p>About Amazon Web Services</p><p> Since 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud.

I discuss two key levels that investors should watch as Amazon gets ready for its Q4 earnings presentation. HJBC I am very bullish with respect to the upcoming earnings presentation of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Amazon will report its 4Q-22 earnings on Thursday, February 2, 2023, and I believe the eCommerce company has a good chance of exceeding low profit expectations. I also believe that the outlook for 1Q-23 could be better than expected, and that too much negativity is currently priced into Amazon's valuation. Because the company's stock has a compelling sales valuation, it's a buy both before and after Amazon reports fourth-quarter earnings next week. Earnings Expectations Are Way Too Low If I had to bet on whether Amazon will beat profit estimates for 4Q-22, I would bet that the company will fly past earnings estimates because profit expectations are irrationally low.

Read full disclaimer. Our pick: Which powerline network adapter is best? Powerline adapters are like the best Wi-Fi extenders in that they’re all nearly identical in design and boring as stale toast. But if we must spotlight one specific adapter, TP-Link’s TL-PA9020P kit is a solid choice with its dual Gigabit Ethernet ports and capacity for Multi-Gig speeds using your home’s electrical wiring.

Read full disclaimer. What should you look for in a powerline adapter? Speed should be your top priority. Electrical wiring is unshielded, so there can be a lot of interference slowing down the connection between adapters. Get a powerline kit with a high transmission rate if you can—you’ll probably see a quarter of that speed at the most, so the higher, the better. You should also consider adapters with pass-through electrical sockets so you don’t lose an outlet when you plug an adaptor into the wall. The sockets are filtered too, meaning your connected device won’t add more electrical noise than what you already have plaguing your home’s wiring. Best overall—TP-Link TL-PA9020P Best overall View on Amazon *Amazon.com Price (as of 1/18/23 09:06 MST). Read full disclaimer. We like that both adapters in the TL-PA9020P kit have dual Gigabit Ethernet ports, especially on the router end, since you lose a LAN port to the adapter. The kit has a great max transmission rate too, but your top speed depends on your home’s wiring and everything connected to it. Theoretically, the kit has a range of up to 984 feet, but your walls and ceilings can hide a lot of length, so the practical distance may be shorter than you think. You can pair up to 16 adapters within that range if you need to expand your connections. Pros: Dual Gigabit Ethernet ports Pass-through outlet Cons: No Wi-Fi connectivity Side-mounter LEDs Best for budgets—TP-Link TL-PA7017P Best for budgets View on Amazon *Amazon.com Price (as of 1/18/23 09:06 MST). Read full disclaimer. This powerline adapter kit is a watered-down version of the TP-Link TL-PA9020P kit listed above. It has half the transmission rate and half the Gigabit Ethernet ports for about half the cost. It should be plenty if you need a smidge more speed in areas where Wi-Fi can’t reach. Like with the TL-PA9020P kit, you can create a single TL-PA7017P powerline network with up to 16 nodes—you can even mix and match compatible TP-Link HomePlug AV2 powerline adapters. Also, the built-in pass-through socket is filtered, so no worries about adding extra electrical noise that can disrupt your powerline network. Pros: Great price Pass-through outlet Cons: Lackluster speed No Wi-Fi connectivity Best for speed—Zyxel PLA6456BB Best for speed View on Amazon *Amazon.com Price (as of 1/18/23 09:06 MST). Read full disclaimer. Zyxel’s powerline kit has the fastest transmission speeds on our list, thanks to its use of the newer Gigabit Home Networking (G.hn) standard, which theoretically enables speeds up to 2,400 Mbps. In real-world use cases, you may see 600 Mbps tops, and that’s the best you’ll probably get from networking across noisy power lines until the technology improves. Other callouts include its impressive range, easy plug-and-play setup, and included pass-through electrical socket, which prevents you from losing a power connection. The adapter’s power-saving feature claims to reduce power consumption by up to 90% by going into standby mode automatically when the adapter idles. Pros: Fast speeds Best range Cons: No Wi-Fi Lower node count Best for Wi-Fi—TP-Link TL-WPA7617 Best for Wi-Fi View on Amazon *Amazon.com Price (as of 1/18/23 09:06 MST). Read full disclaimer. We generally don’t like to suggest powerline kits with Wi-Fi because you’d probably be better off with a traditional Wi-Fi extender. But if you can’t or don’t want to use Ethernet or Wi-Fi to widen your home network, TP-Link’s TL-WPA7617 kit is here to help. At first glance, the adapter seems best for IoT devices because real-world powerline speeds are slow, and the Wi-Fi 5 standard is outdated. The big callout here is OneMesh compatibility and how the adapter chooses the best connection (Wi-Fi or powerline) to receive and send data to the router. To get the most out of this kit, you need a compatible TP-Link OneMesh router. Also, keep in mind that you’ll lose a wall plug since the Wi-Fi unit doesn’t have a pass-through socket (but the router-side unit does). Pros: AC1300 Wi-Fi access OneMesh support Cons: Single pass-thru socket High price Best nano kit—TRENDnet TPL-422E2K Best nano kit View on Amazon *Amazon.com Price (as of 1/18/23 09:06 MST). Read full disclaimer. If you don’t need pass-through sockets on your powerline adapters, TRENDnet’s TPL-422E2K starter kit should be ideal. It’s a bit more expensive than Zyxel’s kit, which packs more speed and longer range, but the compact design of each unit keeps them inconspicuous—great for offices. This kit’s theoretical speed is middling compared to other TP-Link kits. However, it supports only up to eight units in a single powerline network, where other powerline kits support up to 16. But theoretically, you could pair this kit with any other powerline adapter based on the HomePlug AV standard. Pros: Compact design Easy installation Cons: No Wi-Fi connectivity No pass-thru sockets Powerline network adapter specs and features All powerline adapters have the same mission: extend your home network using existing electrical wiring. As a result, they have nearly identical features across the board. Here are a few specifics to look for when shopping for a new kit. Speed The higher the transfer rate, the better. Electrical wiring wasn’t designed to deliver data, so there’s no shielding to reduce interference. If a powerline adapter has a theoretical transfer rate of 2,000 Mbps, you may see a quarter of that speed at most between two units. Your real-world speed depends on your electrical wiring, the power outlets, the devices you have plugged in, and the circuit breakers. Pass-through power outlet Get a powerline adapter with a pass-through socket if you’re in a space where power outlets are in high demand. These sockets let you keep the same number of working power outlets while maintaining your wired internet connections. Generally, these powerline adapters plug into the bottom socket on a wall outlet. But their size may prevent you from plugging a power connector with a ground prong (like desktop power cables) into the top socket. You should be fine with plugs without the third prong. Gigabit Ethernet All powerline adapters listed here have at least one Gigabit Ethernet port. In the typical scenario, you plug one adapter into a router and the other adapter into a wired device. You don’t want a Fast Ethernet port on an adapter, which has a max speed of 100 Mbps versus 1,000 Mbps with Gigabit Ethernet. Since you want the most out of your connection, Gigabit Ethernet is best. Shopping around for new internet? Enter your zip code below to see which providers are available in your area. Our verdict It’s hard to pick our favorite blade of grass, and that’s what it feels like while selecting the best powerline adapter. They all look identical and do the same thing. But TP-Link’s TL-PA9020P kit hits that “just right” sweet spot in our book. We like the extra Gigabit Ethernet port, especially on the router side, so you don’t lose a LAN port. The speed is decent, and the pass-through socket is a great extra. Get the TP-Link TL-PA9020P kit FAQ about powerline network adapters Who should use powerline networking? Use a powerline adapter if most of your home network works fine, but you need a more reliable, wired connection for one or two devices. For example, a powerline connection would be great for the PC in your basement that never gets a reliable Wi-Fi signal. However, powerline networking isn’t a replacement for wiring your home with Ethernet if you need a bunch of fast wired connections. Why don’t I see the advertised speeds? Your home’s electrical wiring isn’t designed to deliver data. The wires don’t have shielding to block all the electrical noise interfering with connections between adapters. Plus, your real-world speeds depend on how your home is wired (copper vs. aluminum), the electrical system’s age, wall outlet types, and installed circuit breakers. You may find that sticking with Wi-Fi 6 is a far better option than powerline. Check out our picks for the best Wi-Fi 6 routers you can get. What interferes with powerline transmissions? Anything that causes electrical noise reduces transmission speeds between powerline adapters. Here’s a list of examples: Appliances Power supplies (device chargers) Surge protectors Fluorescent lights Light dimmers How do I improve my powerline network’s performance? We put together a list of Dos and Don’ts so you can get the most out of your powerline network: Do Don’t Plug adapters directly into a wall socket Keep adapters on the same circuit Unplug nearby device chargers Keep adapters away from appliances Plug an adapter into a power strip Plug an adapter into a surge protector Plug an adapter into an extension cord Plug in an adapter near an appliance Plug an adapter into an AFCI outlet Plug an adapter into a GFCI outlet Share outlets with fluorescent lights HomePlug vs. G.hn: What’s the difference? Both are networking standards used to deliver data across a medium. The HomePlug standard primarily focuses on electrical wiring, whereas Gigabit Home Networking (G.hn) adds support for coax cable, telephone lines, and Ethernet cables. HomePlug AV2 was introduced in 2011 and is still widely used in powerline products, although the older HomePlug Alliance is now inactive. The G.hn Wave 2 standard—developed by the International Telecommunication Union—arrived in 2016 and is expected to be succeeded by Wave 3 in 2023. What does “use the same circuit” mean? Some homes may have more than one circuit breaker box. For example, there may be one feeding the main house and one feeding a garage turned into a three-room rental. Keep the powerline adapters connected to the same circuit breaker box. You may even see the best performance from adapters on the same circuit breaker.

Amazon.com bulls will hope to hear the company announce they've not only beaten that estimate, but also to provide positive guidance, or forecasted growth, for the next quarter. New investors should note that it is sometimes not an earnings beat or miss that most affects the price of a stock, but the guidance (or forecast).

        "title": "Amazon's Ring Is Building A Mini Security Drone That Can Fly Around Your House",
        "content": "Ring revolutionized the home security industry with its namesake doorbell. The startup initially catapulted to mainstream attention after it showed up on the popular startup investing show “Shark Tank.” It originally was called Doorbot but rebranded to Ring shortly after its “Shark Tank” debut. The startup didn’t get an investment from any sharks, but it did manage to get acquired by Amazon.com Inc. AMZN for $1 billion. Since it’s been under the Amazon umbrella, Ring has released a number of new and innovative solutions. Recently, Ring released its new dashcam, which contains many of the same features as its doorbell. It’s also released several other products like smart lighting and door locks. What happened: Ring’s next-generation product, while still on-brand, is a bit less traditional. The company plans to release a mini security drone that can fly around your house. Users can program the drone to fly along custom paths to see what is happening around their house anytime from anywhere. If, for example, your front door alarm is triggered, the drone will undock and fly to the area to see what’s going on. Using the drone's built-in video camera, you can monitor anything that's happening from your phone. While the product won’t be available until at least 2024, this isn’t a vanity project or reach goal. The product is available for users by invitation. This shouldn’t be surprising because home security products are becoming incredibly advanced. MaxTracker, for example, is a startup integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into its security products. The startup creates small GPS trackers about the size of a thick credit card. The trackers have a battery life of up to a year and can use AI to distinguish between a bike being stolen versus getting knocked over or an older person falling down versus dropping their tracker. MaxTracker is raising funds to develop its products, meaning anyone can invest in the company for a limited time. Similarly, Amazon has been developing drone technology for years. It began testing Prime Air in 2013 but didn’t begin rolling out the program commercially until November. Amazon has had years of perfecting the technology, so it’s likely there will be further integrations of drone technology into the Amazon suite of products."

        "title": "The strange link between a forgotten sex cult and a president’s murder",
        "content": "Listen 5 min Share Comment on this storyComment Add to your saved storiesSave correction An earlier version of this review incorrectly stated that President James Garfield had completed six months in office on the day that he was shot. While that was true at the time of his death, he had been in office for under four months when he was shot. On July 2, 1881, President James Garfield was in a good mood. Having completed a few months in office, Gaffy, as at least one of his friends called him, was going on vacation. It was a welcome break from the presidency, which Garfield found tedious and depressing. After doing a handspring over a bed in the White House, the 49-year-old president headed to the Baltimore and Potomac railroad station. He was accompanied by Secretary of State James Blaine — and no security. While waiting for the train, he was suddenly shot twice and fell to the ground. Though he survived the initial incident, Garfield would ultimately succumb to his wounds a few months later. The killer, Charles Guiteau, was delusional and obsessive, a stalker who believed that murdering Garfield would save the Republican Party. He was also a former member of a New York utopian colony, the Oneida Community. WpGet the full experience.Choose your plan ArrowRight Like that once-famous colony, Garfield’s untimely death has been largely forgotten today, but both take on central roles in Susan Wels’s book “An Assassin in Utopia: The True Story of a Nineteenth-Century Sex Cult and a President’s Murder.” Wels has exhaustively researched the assassination and all the factors leading up to it, especially Guiteau’s association with Oneida. Packed with colorful characters and well-chosen details, this book is an engrossing — if at times too wide-ranging — account of Victorian-era American eccentricity. ‘Booth’ imagines the dysfunctional family that created John Wilkes Booth From the outside, the Oneida Community looked idyllic. Led by the preacher John Humphrey Noyes, it was the most successful utopian colony of the period, spanning more than 30 years. At its height, tourists flocked to what Wels describes as the “wild woodland” in Upstate New York, with orchards, livestock, “whizzing mills” and women with “queer cropped hair and shamelessly short skirts.” But behind the facade, Oneida’s free-love philosophies descended into pedophilia, incest and experiments in eugenics. The colony’s bizarre sexual beliefs naturally make for some of the most interesting reading in the book, as Wels knows how to paint a picture without being salacious or distasteful. Guiteau, who joined Oneida at age 19, was no doubt attracted to the colony’s erotic reputation. Unfortunately for him, the women wanted nothing to do with him and mockingly called him “Git Out.” “Sexual frustration, in fact, was the main cause of Guiteau’s misery,” Wels writes, as he “whined about his lack of access to Oneida’s women.” Still, he believed he was a great man in the making, destined to be “famous in this world.” Advertisement His narcissistic aspirations contrast sharply with Garfield’s waning ambitions. As a senator, former Civil War general and family man, Garfield seemed, by middle age, to be content with his life. No one was more shocked than he was when he emerged from the Republican convention as the presidential nominee. Instead of touring the country, he campaigned from the front porch of his Ohio farm, attracting trainloads of visitors. He seemed dismayed when he won. “He had accidentally attained the presidency,” Wels writes, “without the fire and vision for it that drove other candidates.” Share this articleShare Wels has a knack for making connections between disparate facts and coincidences. A hearse “ominously trapped” in Garfield’s inauguration parade becomes, in her hands, sad foreshadowing. Ties to Oneida surrounded the presidency. Roscoe Conkling, Garfield’s biggest political enemy, was a former district attorney in Oneida County and called “the giant of Oneida.” Garfield’s predecessor, Rutherford B. Hayes, was Noyes’s cousin. (Strangely, Hayes’s contentious election, with voter suppression, fraud accusations and simmering violence, had eerie parallels to the 2020 election.) In another coincidence, Abraham Lincoln’s son Robert was at the train station and saw Garfield’s shooting. It was the second presidential assassination he witnessed, having been at his father’s side as he died in 1865. That year, when speaking on Lincoln’s death, Garfield had said he didn’t believe it was “in the American character to become assassins.” In Jon Meacham’s biography, Lincoln is a guiding light for our times At times, Wels seems too caught up in her own research. Large portions of the book cover figures like Margaret Fuller and P.T. Barnum who are only tangentially connected to the story. “An Assassin in Utopia” also touches on a cross-dressing female Civil War spy, the spiritualist Fox sisters, the New York cholera pandemic, the history of the graham cracker, and the beliefs and ill-fated political career of newspaper publisher Horace Greeley — just to name a few threads. Throughout, Guiteau lurks in the background, growing increasingly unhinged as he drifts from one scheme to the next. Unfortunately he’s too thin and uninteresting a character to absorb all the detours, so it’s easy to lose track of why you’re reading about, say, the origins of Greeley, Colo., a place where neither Garfield nor Guiteau set foot. The upside of this approach is that by the time I got to the assassination, I was thoroughly immersed in 1880s Washington, with its shabby White House engulfed in the “stench of sewage rising out of malarial mud flats” outside. The ending is a page turner as Wels describes Garfield’s last days alive, oblivious to Guiteau skulking in the shadows. I felt real sympathy for the charismatic, reluctant president. “An Assassin in Utopia” may not stay focused on the story its title promises, but it does succeed in humanizing Garfield and the tragedy of his early death. “I am bidding goodbye to the freedom of private life, and to a long series of happy years,” Garfield wrote at the beginning of his term, unaware of how true those words would turn out to be.

        "title": "Jane Harper captures a slice of Australia in her Aaron Falk series",
        "content": "Listen 6 min Share Comment on this storyComment A murky, unsolved crime in the past; an Australian setting so dramatic it’s almost a character in itself; a tall, thin Melbourne federal agent with close-cropped, white-blond hair and invisible eyelashes: These are the hallmarks of Jane Harper’s Aaron Falk mysteries. WpGet the full experience.Choose your plan ArrowRight With the publication of “Exiles,” Harper has completed the Falk trilogy, which began in 2017 with “The Dry.” In that novel we met Falk, then 36, working in the financial division of the Australian Federal Police. That makes sense, since Harper was coming to thriller-writing from a business reporting beat at the Herald Sun in Melbourne. Falk was back in “Force of Nature,” published in 2018. Harper then wrote a couple of books off-series — “The Lost Man” in particular built her audience in the United States. While it’s not critical to read the three Falk books in order, it greatly enhances the experience. “Exiles” is set six years after the events of “The Dry,” for instance, and revolves around a friendship established in the earlier book. “The Dry” was set in Kiewarra, a fictional farming community in regional Victoria, five hours from Melbourne. The title refers to the drought raging in the area, sucking the life out of the local economy, creating the imminent threat of wildfire and driving everyone a bit mad. The scorching heat and its effects are never off the page for very long; environment and weather are always key players in Harper’s work. Advertisement This area is where Falk grew up and where he returns in “The Dry” under grisly circumstances: His childhood best friend, Luke, has shot his wife and child and then himself, leaving their younger baby wailing in her crib. Or perhaps there’s some other explanation for the deaths. Falk’s homecoming is hardly a happy one, as he and his father were railroaded out of town when he was a teenager after the death of Falk’s girlfriend under mysterious circumstances. Harper established right away that Falk was no debonair James Bond type, but he is a thoughtful, compassionate man. (With the handsome, dark-eyed Australian actor Eric Bana playing Falk in the film version of “The Dry” and the forthcoming “Force of Nature,” the unprepossessing element of Falk’s persona doesn’t seem to have survived the transition to the screen.) He’s unmarried and a bit of a loner, though quite happy to fall into a friendship with Greg Raco, the personable local policeman on the case, and his pregnant wife, Rita. Raco is relatively new to the town, so he relies on Falk to clarify the knotted, nasty backstories and attitudes of the locals. Drought-related despair is running so high that many people seem to view Luke’s act with as much pity as blame. In “Force of Nature,” Harper sends Falk to the wild Giralang Mountains, another fictionalized but quintessentially Australian location. The crime in the past this time is a notorious set of serial killings in the mountains 20 years earlier. Though the killer died in jail, one victim’s body was never found, and his son may still be on the loose. Nonetheless, a Melbourne boutique accountancy firm has chosen the area for a team-building retreat. Falk and his new partner, Carmen, are already in touch with one of the women in the group, a whistleblower named Alice Russell who has documents that prove her bosses have been involved in money laundering for generations. The five women sent into the woods for the retreat come back late, drenched, bloody, snakebit and down one member — Alice has disappeared. “Force of Nature” ends with Falk phoning up Greg Raco to make a plan for a hike in the Giralang, and the friendship with Raco sets up the situation in “Exiles,” the new book, billed as the last of the series. In a prologue, Falk is on the way with Raco to a fictional part of South Australian wine country, the Marralee Valley, to stand as godfather at the christening of Raco and Rita’s second child, Henry. The baby Rita was pregnant with in “The Dry” is now 5, and though the family still lives in Kiewarra, Marralee is where Raco grew up and where his brother Charlie runs the family winery. The christening was to be held over the same weekend as the local wine and produce festival, a state-fair-type event that makes it a perfect time to visit the area. Advertisement But the first night of the fair, Charlie Raco’s ex-wife Kim, now remarried, parked her new baby’s pram under the Ferris wheel, then disappeared. The search consumed the next few days, and the christening was postponed. Share this articleShare Chapter 1 opens one year later. Kim was never found, though one of her white sneakers turned up stuck in the dam by the reservoir. Some people believe she may have taken her own life. One person who definitely doesn’t go for that theory is Zara, the 17-year-old daughter Kim had with Charlie. Zara’s made up a “Have you seen me?” flier to distribute at the fair. (Connoisseurs will note that there’s always a missing-person flier in an Aaron Falk mystery.) Others believe there may be some connection between a hit-and-run five years earlier, and though the local cop thinks they’re dreaming, Falk doesn’t rule it out. For the first time, Harper gives Falk a love interest: Gemma, the festival director, widowed five years earlier by that unsolved hit-and-run. She and Falk already know there’s a spark between them — they met in Melbourne a while back when both were supposed to see Raco for a drink and he never showed. Well, that was then, this is now. By the time of the christening, Falk has a brief fantasy that he and Gemma are in that church for another reason. Advertisement But what happened to Kim Gillespie? In such a tightknit community, how does a person just disappear? Though she makes a point of careful plotting and neatly tied-up threads, Harper’s books are as much about Australian society and the pressures and dangers of the country’s landscape as they are about finding missing people and solving murders. Social issues like domestic abuse, addiction and bullying play a significant role in her plots, and “Exiles” is no exception. The ability to spot subtle warning signs of a troubled soul is probably Falk’s greatest gift as an investigator, leading him to look for answers about Kim’s fate very close to home. Exiles By Jane Harper Flatiron. 368 pp. $27.99 A previous version of this story incorrectly said that Gemma, a character in “Exiles,” had been selected as Zoe’s godmother. It also misstated the character whose christening Aaron Falk was attending in that book. This story has been updated.

A source alerted The Post to the listing, first discovered by a Chinese-American teenager who was told to bring in a China-themed jersey for a school event. The student, whose family is from Hong Kong, shopped for the jersey on Amazon. The Post obtained a screenshot of the shopper’s Amazon results for “China flag jersey,” which displayed the bumper stick in the first row, among products that appeared unrelated to the search topic. When The Post searched Amazon’s marketplace for the phrase “China T-shirt,” the site displayed similar results, with the bumper sticker listed near the top of the page. After a review, Amazon said the bumper sticker was incorrectly included in the customer’s search results and has been removed from appearing in the query in the future. 3 Amazon said the bumper sticker was incorrectly listed in the search result. Amazon “Customer trust is a top priority, and we work to maintain that trust throughout the shopping experience,” Amazon spokesperson Alyssa Bronikowski said in a statement. “We continuously monitor our store and act quickly if we find or are alerted about an issue.” While Amazon has policies in place to govern potentially vulgar or offensive content, the definition of what constitutes a violation can be murky, according to James Thomson, a former Amazon insider who is a consultant to Amazon sellers. “It’s hard to define what the difference is between offensive and censorship,” Thomson said. “I think if Amazon found out this product is listed someone there might think, yeah, we shouldn’t have this…it’s a gray zone of what constitutes offensive material,” Thomson added. Thomson noted a search for the word “f–k” yields more than 8,000 results on Amazon. 3 The bumper also appeared in results for “China T-shirts.” Amazon Amazon detailed its approach to the sale of “controversial products and content” in a blog post updated last month. “Our offensive and controversial products policies prohibits the sale of products that promote, incite, or glorify hatred, violence, racial, sexual, or religious intolerance or promote organizations with such views, as well as listings that graphically portray violence or victims of violence,” the company said in the post. “We periodically review and update these policies based on experience, current events, and other relevant developments, and in consultation with internal and external resources,” the company added. The “F—k China” bumper sticker is offered by a California-based artist named Brian Bula, who sells an array of products with slogans catering to all sides of the political spectrum. Other bumper stickers in his Amazon store say “F—k Putin,” “F—K Joe Biden” and “Trump 20-24 Years In Prison.” 3 The product listing page for the bumper sticker. Amazon Bula’s website describes him as “politically independent with friends on the right and left.” When reached for comment, Bula noted that he also sells a “I Love China” button design — and has no control over where Amazon’s algorithm lists his products in search. “As I am sure you know, Amazon’s algorithms decide what products to show, and search results are personalized and impacted by prior searches and information Amazon collects on and off its marketplace,” Bula said. “Many of my products are political and me, and my products, are continually attacked by partisans with political motives – from both sides,” he added."

        "content": "What happened Shares of Amazon.com (AMZN -2.99%) fell 8.4% on Friday after the online retail colossus warned of a downturn in its most profitable business. So what Amazon's net sales grew by 9% year over year to $149.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Gains in the e-commerce giant's North American segment more than offset declines in its international operations. Yet growth in the company's key Amazon Web Services (AWS) business slowed markedly. AWS's revenue rose 20% to $21.4 billion. That's down from 27% growth in the third quarter and 40% in the year-ago period. \"Starting back in the middle of the third quarter of 2022, we saw our year-over-year growth rates slow as enterprises of all sizes evaluated ways to optimize their cloud spending in response to the tough macroeconomic conditions,\" Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said during a conference call with analysts. \"As expected, these optimization efforts continued into the fourth quarter.\" To better withstand the downturn, Amazon is slashing expenses. The company said in January that it would reduce its workforce by more than 18,000 employees. Amazon also shuttered many of its brick-and-mortar stores and pared back the expansion of its massive e-commerce fulfillment network. Still, Amazon's operating income fell more than 20% to $2.7 billion. Severance costs and impairment charges contributed to the decline. Now what Olsavsky said Amazon would work with its cloud customers to help them reduce costs. \"As we look ahead, we expect these optimization efforts will continue to be a headwind to AWS growth in at least the next couple of quarters,\" Olsavsky said. \"So far in the first month of the year, AWS year-over-year revenue growth is in the mid-teens.\" With AWS's pace of expansion slowing, Amazon expects its revenue to grow by only 4% to 8% to between $121 billion and $126 billion in the first quarter of 2023. \"In the short term, we face an uncertain economy, but we remain quite optimistic about the long-term opportunities for Amazon,\" CEO Andy Jassy said."

Doug Herrington, CEO of Worldwide Amazon Stores, said in the 60 largest U.S. metro areas, more than half of Prime member packages arrived on the same day or the next day from when they ordered them. He added so far this year, 1.8 billion units were shipped to U.S. Prime members on the same day or next day, more than four times what was delivered at those speeds before the pandemic in 2019. Amazon has achieved quicker delivery times by dividing the country into smaller, easier-to-reach regions, using machine-learning technology to better predict buying trends, and growing its same-day delivery network, Herrington explained. By making those changes, Amazon also reduced costs, which in turn helped customers save money, he said. Shares of Amazon advanced 1.1% following the news and traded around their 2023 highs.

Amazon Clinic was introduced in November as a virtual health service operating in 32 states, now extended to all 50 states and Washington, D.C.

With Amazon Clinic, users can compare response times and rates of different healthcare providers, complete a questionnaire, and connect with their chosen provider without an appointment or insurance. The clinician provides a treatment plan, which may include a prescription that can be filled at Amazon Pharmacy or any other pharmacy. The ecommerce giant has been attempting to expand into the healthcare sector for the past few years. In 2018, it bought the online pharmacy PillPack for $750 million. In 2020, it launched Amazon Pharmacy as a full-service online pharmacy with savings for Prime members.

Geologic time. There’s no short-term problem we can’t wait out.” The oil business, as we see through the experiences of the protagonist, Bunny, is untouchable — removed from all human intention but everywhere, inescapable, looming unmoved over all the characters and all the Earth’s “short-term problems.” WpGet the full experience.Choose your plan ArrowRight Kiesling tidily gathers these “short-term” problems into Bunny’s life story, rendering them, through her perspective, urgent as well as “overwhelming and very boring.” The arc of “Mobility” is a brief segment of the history of global capitalism and climate change. As a child, Bunny sees the breakup of the Soviet Union and the scramble for oil in the Caspian Sea. From Baku, where her father is stationed as a diplomat, she witnesses the immediate effects of conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. She watches Russia annex Crimea, and “seagulls cleaned off with toothbrushes” after the Deepwater Horizon spill. But of course, the Earth’s short-term problems are monumental in an individual human life. And as such, “Mobility” is really a bildungsroman, the story of a girl trying to keep up with sweeping changes. When we first meet Bunny, she is a bored teenager, barely tolerating the inconveniences of life overseas, only vaguely aware of the stakes of history happening around her. Advertisement Her inability to grasp the magnitude of reality continues into her adult life. She scrapes through college, gets dumped for her lack of ambition and works random jobs, unable to hold a steady sense of future rewards and consequences. She moves back to her childhood home in Texas and stumbles into a temp job at a geoengineering company, where she proofreads long reports that she can’t understand. The geological scale of the novel, intensified by explanations about the state of the world that Kiesling works into dialogue between Bunny and others, is all the more overwhelming from Bunny’s narrow, earnest point of view. When she starts transitioning into the energy industry, she says to a pro-oil consultant, “I saw ‘An Inconvenient Truth,’” trying desperately to sound informed. “The earth is getting warmer. … It’s, like, a fact. Species are going extinct every minute?” When she visits her brother and his girlfriend, Sofie, staunch socialists living in Europe, she feels suffocated by their moral code, struggling to enjoy the “infinitely kind water of the Aegean” over their grating admonishment of her decision to work at an oil company. The reader feels Bunny’s exhaustion and boredom watching Sofie fight with strangers about the evils of capitalism. “Sofie seemed to live so comfortably with darkness, Bunny thought. Bunny could not imagine living thus. Bunny liked to be optimistic.” Advertisement At its core, “Mobility” is about how political questions fit into a life. Adult Bunny is the average bland, liberal American woman: White, earnest, eager for material comfort. She doesn’t want to be a jerk, but she doesn’t want to have to think too hard about social or economic justice; she believes that Barack Obama is a “symbol of the victory of good over evil” and that the Occupy Wall Street protesters in Zuccotti Park “would be happier if they got jobs.” When Sofie asks her if she likes her work, she simply replies: “I like to get things done. I like to get paid. I like to get my moles removed.” Share this articleShare Like many, Bunny just wants to have a good time and not let the world’s problems harsh her vibe. She raises money for charities and takes care of her mother, Maryellen, encouraging her to become a certified Texas Master Gardener. Gardening plays an interesting role in the story, a quiet, powerful reprieve from — and counterpart to — how the global-scale energy business shapes the characters and events. Sofie, the book’s necessary but exhausting leftist, bonds with the borderline conservative Maryellen over this sincere attempt to “totally remake the earth,” or at least Maryellen’s humble patch of it. Bunny is sympathetic as a 22-year-old administrative assistant trying to adult and maintain health insurance while fielding sermons from much older socialists; she is less sympathetic as a 36-year-old executive seeing herself as a diversity factor in male-dominated conference rooms and cheating on her fiancé with a rakish activist with whom she argues that the oil industry empowers women. Advertisement Kiesling leaves readers with a troubling awareness of the role we play in our ecological future, and a bleak sense that the new normal is like the old one: simultaneously overwhelming and underwhelming. But Bunny and her mother continue to appreciate their patch of earth. On one excessively hot day, Maryellen pushes aside a shriveled fig plant to reveal a tiny green sprout. In Kiesling’s rendering of humanity and our planet, life simply goes on. And Bunny is still here, focusing on signs of life in her small garden rather than mass extinction, hopeful about the future.

Now safely settled with his family in Washington, he’s one of the few who escaped. WpGet the full experience.Choose your plan ArrowRight It seems fitting, then, that Izgil’s lucid and quietly terrifying memoir, “Waiting to Be Arrested at Night,” while alive with heartbreaking tributes to writer friends now vanished into the camps, repeatedly returns to moments of eerie silence. Names of the disappeared are whispered on the street. Conversations end abruptly, and children vanish from school. Izgil, a groundbreaking poet and filmmaker whose work blends a love of Uyghur traditions with “that murky abstract stuff,” in the words of a Chinese police officer, cuts dangerous lines from his own verse. In a neighborhood police station, a tortured man screams, and a policeman hurries to shut the basement door. Advertisement That stifled cry, which Izgil hears while waiting to complete yet another form, haunts the book. Through its years-long crackdown, China has sent 1 million or more Uyghurs and Turkic minorities to a sprawling network of reeducation centers while subjecting them to sterilization, forced labor and torture. Outside the camps officials have razed mosques and bulldozed cemeteries. How does one surviving poet tell the story of a campaign to erase his entire culture? Izgil is, of course, not the only Uyghur author to tackle the question. Gulbahar Haitiwaji takes us inside the walls in “How I Survived a Chinese ‘Reeducation’ Camp,” while recent memoirs from exiled activists Gulchehra Hoja and Nury Turkel blend personal stories with broader accounts of the long Uyghur struggle. Izgil, who had long published both poems and criticism but released his first collection of poetry just as the roundups began, cuts a different path. He could certainly have written a big-picture view if he chose. As a young scholar, Izgil wrote the first broad Uyghur-language survey of Western modernist literature. He might have also dwelled on the three years he spent in labor camps in the 1990s, but those dark days are barely mentioned here. Instead, the poet keeps his head down, narratively speaking, and blends contemporary stories of family, friends and even the police officers who harass him into a ground-level account of the collapse of Uyghur society. Advertisement The result, translated by Joshua Freeman, is a lived-in page-turner with the slow, grim boil of a Le Carré novel (no shooting, but no hope of justice either, with plenty of code words and offstage violence), threaded with a few of Izgil’s short, striking poems. Together they tell a story immediately accessible to anyone who’s ever found themselves tied up in red tape — and capture, in harrowing miniature, a portrait of horrors we can scarcely imagine. Share this articleShare The story opens in 2009 with a police interrogation, all too routine for many Uyghurs. Izgil clings to normalcy (“In my experience, reacting too strongly was unhelpful in these situations”) but soon is forced to surrender his email and social media passwords. Things unravel from there: Censors order Izgil to erase the greeting “assalamu alaikum” (“Peace be upon you”) from his film scripts; all Uyghurs soon learn to skip the phrase in public. Radios and youth soccer leagues are banned, as are ordinary household objects such as matches. Anything remotely religious is forbidden; Izgil’s neighbors take turns throwing Qurans down a manhole at midnight, while others take out newspaper ads announcing that they’ve changed their own names. China’s Xinjiang faces long road to rehabilitation The newspapers have plenty of room. The crackdown’s official announcements are few, and a near-total information blackout leaves Uyghurs living “like frogs at the bottom of a well.” I learned to dread the words “We had heard…,” which Izgil uses to introduce each new turn of the screw. Some gossip comes coded: To be sent to the camps is to “study,” the wider crackdown is a “storm.” Other whispers are all too exact, as when police summon Izgil and his wife to sign what they understand to be their final papers before the camps: “I had heard about this form.” Driving home through Urumqi one evening in June 2017, Izgil spots truckloads of armed military police raiding a Uyghur neighborhood, accompanied by neighborhood committee officials with “blue clipboards in their hands.” The terror has become real. Personal experience and rumor have their narrative limits; those seeking a deep dive on, say, Xinjiang’s 2009 Uyghur-Han riots must look elsewhere. But we don’t turn to poets like Izgil for crunchy history. Instead, read “Waiting to Be Arrested at Night” for its many human-scale moments of sorrow and grace. Advertisement As the crackdown rages outside, Izgil takes us inside the smoke-filled Urumqi convenience store where his writer friends gather in the evenings. Business is slow. Almas the shopkeeper translates Bertrand Russell just to keep busy, one arm pinned with the red armband that police require all merchants to wear. Eli the ponytailed bookseller has run out of Uyghur books to sell. The novelist Perhat Tursun is there, wearily chain-smoking, his passport forever revoked. Foreign countries, he grumbles, are like “a woman I was in love with but couldn’t marry.” Izgil, working on his own plans to flee, holds back a final farewell. Anyone who knew would be in even greater danger. After a long-shot bureaucratic prayer releases their confiscated passports, Izgil and his family flee China in August 2017 to seek asylum in Washington, home to one of the United States’ largest Uyghur communities. The Urumqi convenience store is shuttered now; friends report that Almas and Eli have been arrested and sent to “study.” Pain and survivor’s guilt smolder beneath Izgil’s calm and careful prose, bursting into flame in his poems: “These days / are crowded with shattered horizons / shattered!” He now lives trapped in “the runaway season / when surrender hides deep in the suitcase / when noble doubts run over the weight limit.” In 2020, Izgil learns that Tursun has been sentenced to 16 years in prison. Desperate for news, he calls the novelist’s office. The woman who answers listens silently as he pleads for news, then hangs up without a word. Only then, Izgil writes, did he understand he’d truly lost his friend forever: “We will see these dear ones only in our dreams.” Dan Keane is a freelance writer based in New Zealand and a former senior lecturer at NYU Shanghai.

These innovative changes encompass: 1. Allowing non-Prime members to place grocery orders, expanding accessibility to a wider customer base. 2. Streamlining the online grocery shopping experience by integrating the carts of Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh, and Amazon.com. This will offer customers a seamless and convenient purchasing process. 3. Shifting the focus away from the costly “Just Walk Out” system in physical stores. This move reflects Amazon’s commitment to refining its brick-and-mortar grocery strategy. These strategic adjustments align with Amazon’s ongoing endeavors to revitalize its presence in the grocery industry. In pursuit of a stronger market position, the company has been harnessing cutting-edge technology, exemplified by its cashierless grocery stores, to meet the evolving demands of consumers. Furthermore, Amazon has decided to temporarily halt the expansion of its Fresh and Go stores as part of this grocery strategy overhaul. Despite its e-commerce dominance, Amazon has faced challenges in establishing a successful grocery business. To further solidify its position, Amazon intends to increase the minimum order requirement for free Amazon Fresh grocery delivery under Prime. Effective February 28, 2023, the minimum order size will be raised from the current threshold of $35 to an elevated limit of over $150. Amazon is always striving to provide innovative solutions for its customers, and the latest addition to this endeavor is Amazon Hub Counters. These progressive changes demonstrate Amazon’s unwavering commitment to adapt to the dynamic landscape of the grocery industry and provide enhanced services to its customers. Amazons Stock Performance and Financial Outlook: August 2, 2023 On August 2, 2023, Amazon’s (AMZN) stock opened at $130.13, slightly lower than the previous day’s closing price of $131.72. Throughout the trading day, the stock’s price fluctuated within a range of $128.02 to $130.23. The trading volume for the day was 898,701 shares, significantly below the average volume of 59,589,832 shares over the past three months. Amazon’s market capitalization stood at $1.4 trillion. Despite its enormous size, Amazon has continued to experience impressive earnings growth. While the company reported a negative earnings growth of -108.10% last year, it has rebounded significantly with a positive earnings growth of +696.87% this year. Looking ahead, analysts forecast a robust earnings growth of +58.74% for the next five years. In terms of revenue growth, Amazon achieved a solid +9.40% growth rate last year. The company’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 305.6, which suggests that investors are willing to pay a premium for Amazon’s earnings. The price-to-sales ratio was 1.67, while the price-to-book ratio stood at 9.27. On August 2, 2023, Amazon’s stock experienced a slight decline, with a decrease of -6.57 points or -7.29% compared to the previous day’s closing price. This decline was in line with the overall performance of the retail trade sector, as other major companies in the industry also experienced negative changes in their stock prices. Amazon is expected to release its next earnings report on August 4, 2023. Analysts forecast an earnings per share (EPS) of $0.35 for the current quarter. In the previous year, Amazon reported annual revenue of $514.0 billion but incurred a net loss of -$2.7 billion.

Like for many of its Big Tech brethren, it’s been a good year so far for the ecommerce giant, with shares up by 53% year-to-date. The positive market sentiment is acknowledged by Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter, who expects a “solid print for Q2 and a good guide for Q3.” Pachter, though, brings attention to the recent strong share price action, and therefore says his share price appreciation expectations “are capped.” Nevertheless, Pachter has raised his price target on AMZN to $146 (from $129), indicating the stock has room for further growth of ~14% from current levels. Pachter’s rating stays an Outperform (i.e., Buy). (To watch Pachter’s track record, click here) As for what to anticipate in the readout, the analyst expects Amazon to reap the benefits of an increase in overall macro sentiment during Q2, particularly in its advertising, online stores, and subscriptions segments. Meanwhile, AWS is predicted to remain flattish. Numbers wise, Pachter sees Q2 revenue hitting $131 billion, up from $127 billion in Q1 and above the midpoint of the guide ($127 – 133 billion). The consensus estimate aligns closely at $131.5 billion. Pachter thinks there could be over $2.2 billion in combined growth for online stores (at around $300 million), physical stores ($300 million), and third-party seller services ($1.6 billion), based on “recent sequential trends combined with an improving macro environment and upward pricing pressure.” Further growth of $800 million should come from ad services, while subscription services could post growth of $300 million. On the other hand, impacted by “market maturity,” other incumbents “buying market share,” and Amazon’s countering decision to cut pricing so to stay competitive, Amazon Web Services (AWS) will most probably “grow slowly.” As for the third quarter, Pachter sees the record sales notched during this year’s Prime Day event ensuring the guide could come in near to the Street’s expectations of $138 billion, which is just above Pachter’s Q3 forecast for revenue of $137 billion. Turning now to the rest of the Street, where Amazon is that rare beast – a stock with plenty of coverage and all of it positive. The stock’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on a unanimous 29 Buys. The average target stands at $152.52, representing one-year gains of ~19% from current levels.

Competitive advantage refers to factors that allow a company to produce goods or services better or more cheaply than its rivals. These factors allow the productive entity to generate more sales or superior margins compared to its market rivals. Competitive advantages are attributed to a variety of factors including cost structure, branding, the quality of product offerings, the distribution network, intellectual property, and customer service. Investopedia / Michela Buttignol Understanding Competitive Advantage Competitive advantages generate greater value for a firm and its shareholders because of certain strengths or conditions. The more sustainable the competitive advantage, the more difficult it is for competitors to neutralize the advantage. The two main types of competitive advantages are comparative advantage and differential advantage. A comparative advantage is when a firm can produce products more efficiently and at a lower cost than its competitors. A differential advantage is when a firm's products or services differ from its competitors' offerings and are seen as superior. Advanced technology, patent-protected products or processes, superior personnel, and strong brand identity are all drivers of differential advantage. These factors support wide margins and large market shares. For example, Apple is famous for creating innovative products, such as the iPhone, and supporting its market leadership with savvy marketing campaigns to build an elite brand. Another example is major drug companies. They can market branded drugs at high price points because they are protected by patents. How To Build a Competitive Advantage To build a competitive advantage, a company can use one of three main methods: Cost: Provide offerings at the lowest price Differentiation: Provide offerings that are superior in quality, service, or features Specialization: Provide offerings narrowly tailored to a focused market Competing on price can be effective, but if you slash prices too much you risk decreasing profit margins to an untenable level. Many firms opt instead to differentiate themselves in other ways, which helps preserve or expand their profit margin. Benefits of a Competitive Advantage When a company creates a durable competitive advantage, it sets itself apart from the competition and provides value to customers as well as stakeholders. By producing a desirable product or service that is better or more cost-effective than its competitors,' the company can make more sales, generate more revenue, and enjoy greater profits. Strategies to Build a Competitive Advantage To build a competitive advantage, a company must know what sets it apart from its competitors and then focus its message, service, and products with that difference in mind. Here are several strategies companies use to build a competitive advantage: Research the market: Market research helps a company identify and define its target market, which can guide it in developing the most effective advantage. Identify strengths: A company can find its unique strengths, especially relative to competitors, by reviewing products, services, features, positioning, and branding. Evaluate finances: Companies can take a close look at their financial performance to spot profit centers and areas of stability, using financial statements and ratios. Review operations: How efficient is a company's operations? Where is it effective, and where is there room for improvement? Consider customer service as well as production and supply chain management. Consider human resources: The talent a company can attract as employees and leadership can make an important difference in the success of the business. Evaluating company culture, hiring, and staffing practices can help. Competitive Advantage vs. Comparative Advantage A firm's ability to produce a good or service more efficiently than its competitors, which leads to greater profit margins, creates a comparative advantage. Rational consumers will choose the cheaper of any two perfect substitutes offered. For example, a car owner will buy gasoline from a gas station that is 5 cents cheaper than other stations in the area. For imperfect substitutes, like Pepsi versus Coke, higher margins for the lowest-cost producers can eventually bring superior returns. Economies of scale, efficient internal systems, and geographic location can also create a comparative advantage. For example, a firm that manufactures a product in China may have lower labor costs than a company that manufactures in the U.S., so it can offer an equal product at a lower price. In the context of international trade economics, opportunity cost determines comparative advantages. Amazon (AMZN) is an example of a company focused on building and maintaining a comparative advantage. The e-commerce platform has a level of scale and efficiency that is difficult for retail competitors to replicate, allowing it to rise to prominence largely through price competition. How Do I Know If a Company Has a Competitive Advantage? If a business can increase its market share through increased efficiency or productivity, it would have a competitive advantage over its competitors. How Can a Company Increase Its Competitive Advantage? Lasting competitive advantages tend to be things competitors cannot easily replicate or imitate. Warren Buffet calls sustainable competitive advantages economic moats, which businesses can figuratively dig around themselves to entrench competitive advantages. This can include strengthening one's brand, raising barriers to new entrants (such as through regulations), and the defense of intellectual property. Why Do Larger Companies Often Have Competitive Advantages? Competitive advantages that accrue from economies of scale typically refer to supply-side advantages, such as the purchasing power of a large restaurant or retail chain. But advantages of scale also exist on the demand side—they are commonly referred to as network effects. This happens when a service becomes more valuable to all of its users as the service adds more users. The result can often be a winner-take-all dynamic in the industry. How Is Competitive Advantage Different From Comparative Advantage? Comparative advantage mostly refers to international trade. It posits that a country should focus on what it can produce and export relatively the cheapest—thus if one country has a competitive advantage in producing both products A & B, it should only produce product A if it can do it better than B and import B from some other country. The Bottom Line A company's competitive advantage is the way it excels compared to its rivals. This advantage may be through cost leadership, differentiation, or focus.

The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) on Thursday said workers at the Logan Township, New Jersey, warehouse suffered bodily stress that was causing muscular disorders and neck and back injuries. And Amazon failed to ensure that injured employees received adequate treatment, the agency said. OSHA said it had recommended $15,625 in penalties, which is the maximum fine allowed under U.S. law. Amazon has 15 days to either pay the fine or appeal to a review board. Since January, OSHA has levied about $150,000 in fines on Amazon for allegedly creating hazardous conditions or failing to record work-related injuries at several other warehouses across the country. Separately on Thursday, the Missouri Workers Center, a worker advocacy group, said it had filed a complaint with OSHA on behalf of employees at an Amazon warehouse near St. Louis, Missouri. They claim the online retailer imposes excessive, unsafe work rates and that they were mistreated by Amazon's in-house medical staff. \"OSHA's own prior citations show a pattern of safety violations throughout Amazon's warehouse network, a pattern which is unfortunately reflected in our own experiences,\" the workers said in the complaint. Amazon in a statement provided by a spokesperson said it takes worker safety seriously and plans to appeal the OSHA citation. The company said the rate of worker injuries recorded globally has improved significantly since 2019. Regarding the complaint filed in Missouri, Amazon said it welcomed OSHA inspectors at the \"clean, safe facility.\" The company said the injury rate at the Missouri warehouse is below the industry average and has improved more than 55% since 2019. Story continues \"The vast majority of employees at this facility say in anonymous surveys that they feel safe at work and believe their managers are always looking for ways to enhance safety further,\" Amazon said. Critics of Amazon have long accused the company of putting profit over safety by requiring employees to work at an unsafe pace and forgo breaks to meet demanding quotas. The company's safety record came under renewed scrutiny during the COVID-19 pandemic. Those concerns helped spur union campaigns at warehouses across the country, including one in New York City where workers voted to unionize last year.

And what's next? Amazon's retail operations have positively surprised with improving profit margins. Sundry Photography Rapid Recap As we headed into the earnings print I had a sell rating on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as I had a thesis that AWS had started to see a significant slowdown in revenue growth rates. Furthermore, I didn't buy into the idea that just because AWS was massive, this necessarily equated to Amazon's AI technology being a leading technology. And that was what the market had expected. However, what I had not counted on was that Amazon's retail operations would positively surprise so significantly on the upside. As a professional investor, I am both experienced and humble enough to acknowledge when something isn't performing the way I thought it would, and am more than willing to change my mind when the facts change.

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) reported Monday it made the fastest deliveries ever to its Prime members last quarter. Doug Herrington, CEO of Worldwide Amazon Stores, said in the 60 largest U.S. metro areas, more than half of Prime member packages arrived on the same day or the next day from when they ordered them. He added so far this year, 1.8 billion units were shipped to U.S. Prime members on the same day or next day, more than four times what was delivered at those speeds before the pandemic in 2019. Amazon has achieved quicker delivery times by dividing the country into smaller, easier-to-reach regions, using machine-learning technology to better predict buying trends, and growing its same-day delivery network, Herrington explained. By making those changes, Amazon also reduced costs, which in turn helped customers save money, he said. Shares of Amazon advanced 1.1% following the news and traded around their 2023 highs. YCharts"

Amazon Clinic was introduced in November as a virtual health service operating in 32 states, now extended to all 50 states and Washington, D.C. However, its message-based consultations are still limited to 34 states. With Amazon Clinic, users can compare response times and rates of different healthcare providers, complete a questionnaire, and connect with their chosen provider without an appointment or insurance. The clinician provides a treatment plan, which may include a prescription that can be filled at Amazon Pharmacy or any other pharmacy. The ecommerce giant has been attempting to expand into the healthcare sector for the past few years. In 2018, it bought the online pharmacy PillPack for $750 million. In 2020, it launched Amazon Pharmacy as a full-service online pharmacy with savings for Prime members. Amazon Care was launched in 2019 as a pilot program for its headquarters in Seattle but was discontinued in December 2022. Last year, Amazon closed a $3.9 billion deal to acquire primary care provider One Medical, gaining access to over 200 physical medical offices in 26 markets and about 815,000 members."

        "title": "Can you be a good citizen if you make the world worse?",
        "content": "Listen 5 min Share Comment on this storyComment Add to your saved storiesSave In one of the most remarkable and terrifying scenes in Lydia Kiesling’s new novel, “Mobility,” the patriarch of a family-owned Texas oil company tells his staff: “We don’t think in economic cycles, we don’t think in election cycles … in this industry, we think in earth time. Geologic time. There’s no short-term problem we can’t wait out.” The oil business, as we see through the experiences of the protagonist, Bunny, is untouchable — removed from all human intention but everywhere, inescapable, looming unmoved over all the characters and all the Earth’s “short-term problems.” WpGet the full experience.Choose your plan ArrowRight Kiesling tidily gathers these “short-term” problems into Bunny’s life story, rendering them, through her perspective, urgent as well as “overwhelming and very boring.” The arc of “Mobility” is a brief segment of the history of global capitalism and climate change. As a child, Bunny sees the breakup of the Soviet Union and the scramble for oil in the Caspian Sea. From Baku, where her father is stationed as a diplomat, she witnesses the immediate effects of conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. She watches Russia annex Crimea, and “seagulls cleaned off with toothbrushes” after the Deepwater Horizon spill. But of course, the Earth’s short-term problems are monumental in an individual human life. And as such, “Mobility” is really a bildungsroman, the story of a girl trying to keep up with sweeping changes. When we first meet Bunny, she is a bored teenager, barely tolerating the inconveniences of life overseas, only vaguely aware of the stakes of history happening around her. Advertisement Her inability to grasp the magnitude of reality continues into her adult life. She scrapes through college, gets dumped for her lack of ambition and works random jobs, unable to hold a steady sense of future rewards and consequences. She moves back to her childhood home in Texas and stumbles into a temp job at a geoengineering company, where she proofreads long reports that she can’t understand. The geological scale of the novel, intensified by explanations about the state of the world that Kiesling works into dialogue between Bunny and others, is all the more overwhelming from Bunny’s narrow, earnest point of view. When she starts transitioning into the energy industry, she says to a pro-oil consultant, “I saw ‘An Inconvenient Truth,’” trying desperately to sound informed. “The earth is getting warmer. … It’s, like, a fact. Species are going extinct every minute?” When she visits her brother and his girlfriend, Sofie, staunch socialists living in Europe, she feels suffocated by their moral code, struggling to enjoy the “infinitely kind water of the Aegean” over their grating admonishment of her decision to work at an oil company. The reader feels Bunny’s exhaustion and boredom watching Sofie fight with strangers about the evils of capitalism. “Sofie seemed to live so comfortably with darkness, Bunny thought. Bunny could not imagine living thus. Bunny liked to be optimistic.” Advertisement At its core, “Mobility” is about how political questions fit into a life. Adult Bunny is the average bland, liberal American woman: White, earnest, eager for material comfort. She doesn’t want to be a jerk, but she doesn’t want to have to think too hard about social or economic justice; she believes that Barack Obama is a “symbol of the victory of good over evil” and that the Occupy Wall Street protesters in Zuccotti Park “would be happier if they got jobs.” When Sofie asks her if she likes her work, she simply replies: “I like to get things done. I like to get paid. I like to get my moles removed.” Share this articleShare Like many, Bunny just wants to have a good time and not let the world’s problems harsh her vibe. She raises money for charities and takes care of her mother, Maryellen, encouraging her to become a certified Texas Master Gardener. Gardening plays an interesting role in the story, a quiet, powerful reprieve from — and counterpart to — how the global-scale energy business shapes the characters and events. Sofie, the book’s necessary but exhausting leftist, bonds with the borderline conservative Maryellen over this sincere attempt to “totally remake the earth,” or at least Maryellen’s humble patch of it. Bunny is sympathetic as a 22-year-old administrative assistant trying to adult and maintain health insurance while fielding sermons from much older socialists; she is less sympathetic as a 36-year-old executive seeing herself as a diversity factor in male-dominated conference rooms and cheating on her fiancé with a rakish activist with whom she argues that the oil industry empowers women. Advertisement Kiesling leaves readers with a troubling awareness of the role we play in our ecological future, and a bleak sense that the new normal is like the old one: simultaneously overwhelming and underwhelming. But Bunny and her mother continue to appreciate their patch of earth. On one excessively hot day, Maryellen pushes aside a shriveled fig plant to reveal a tiny green sprout. In Kiesling’s rendering of humanity and our planet, life simply goes on. And Bunny is still here, focusing on signs of life in her small garden rather than mass extinction, hopeful about the future.

        "title": "A poet’s ground-level account of the collapse of Uyghur society",
        "content": "Listen 6 min Share Comment on this storyComment Add to your saved storiesSave When mass detentions swept China’s Xinjiang province in 2017, Tahir Hamut Izgil was one of the rising Uyghur writers of his generation. Now safely settled with his family in Washington, he’s one of the few who escaped. WpGet the full experience.Choose your plan ArrowRight It seems fitting, then, that Izgil’s lucid and quietly terrifying memoir, “Waiting to Be Arrested at Night,” while alive with heartbreaking tributes to writer friends now vanished into the camps, repeatedly returns to moments of eerie silence. Names of the disappeared are whispered on the street. Conversations end abruptly, and children vanish from school. Izgil, a groundbreaking poet and filmmaker whose work blends a love of Uyghur traditions with “that murky abstract stuff,” in the words of a Chinese police officer, cuts dangerous lines from his own verse. In a neighborhood police station, a tortured man screams, and a policeman hurries to shut the basement door. Advertisement That stifled cry, which Izgil hears while waiting to complete yet another form, haunts the book. Through its years-long crackdown, China has sent 1 million or more Uyghurs and Turkic minorities to a sprawling network of reeducation centers while subjecting them to sterilization, forced labor and torture. Outside the camps officials have razed mosques and bulldozed cemeteries. How does one surviving poet tell the story of a campaign to erase his entire culture? Izgil is, of course, not the only Uyghur author to tackle the question. Gulbahar Haitiwaji takes us inside the walls in “How I Survived a Chinese ‘Reeducation’ Camp,” while recent memoirs from exiled activists Gulchehra Hoja and Nury Turkel blend personal stories with broader accounts of the long Uyghur struggle. Izgil, who had long published both poems and criticism but released his first collection of poetry just as the roundups began, cuts a different path. He could certainly have written a big-picture view if he chose. As a young scholar, Izgil wrote the first broad Uyghur-language survey of Western modernist literature. He might have also dwelled on the three years he spent in labor camps in the 1990s, but those dark days are barely mentioned here. Instead, the poet keeps his head down, narratively speaking, and blends contemporary stories of family, friends and even the police officers who harass him into a ground-level account of the collapse of Uyghur society. Advertisement The result, translated by Joshua Freeman, is a lived-in page-turner with the slow, grim boil of a Le Carré novel (no shooting, but no hope of justice either, with plenty of code words and offstage violence), threaded with a few of Izgil’s short, striking poems. Together they tell a story immediately accessible to anyone who’s ever found themselves tied up in red tape — and capture, in harrowing miniature, a portrait of horrors we can scarcely imagine. Share this articleShare The story opens in 2009 with a police interrogation, all too routine for many Uyghurs. Izgil clings to normalcy (“In my experience, reacting too strongly was unhelpful in these situations”) but soon is forced to surrender his email and social media passwords. Things unravel from there: Censors order Izgil to erase the greeting “assalamu alaikum” (“Peace be upon you”) from his film scripts; all Uyghurs soon learn to skip the phrase in public. Radios and youth soccer leagues are banned, as are ordinary household objects such as matches. Anything remotely religious is forbidden; Izgil’s neighbors take turns throwing Qurans down a manhole at midnight, while others take out newspaper ads announcing that they’ve changed their own names. China’s Xinjiang faces long road to rehabilitation The newspapers have plenty of room. The crackdown’s official announcements are few, and a near-total information blackout leaves Uyghurs living “like frogs at the bottom of a well.” I learned to dread the words “We had heard…,” which Izgil uses to introduce each new turn of the screw. Some gossip comes coded: To be sent to the camps is to “study,” the wider crackdown is a “storm.” Other whispers are all too exact, as when police summon Izgil and his wife to sign what they understand to be their final papers before the camps: “I had heard about this form.” Driving home through Urumqi one evening in June 2017, Izgil spots truckloads of armed military police raiding a Uyghur neighborhood, accompanied by neighborhood committee officials with “blue clipboards in their hands.” The terror has become real. Personal experience and rumor have their narrative limits; those seeking a deep dive on, say, Xinjiang’s 2009 Uyghur-Han riots must look elsewhere. But we don’t turn to poets like Izgil for crunchy history. Instead, read “Waiting to Be Arrested at Night” for its many human-scale moments of sorrow and grace. Advertisement As the crackdown rages outside, Izgil takes us inside the smoke-filled Urumqi convenience store where his writer friends gather in the evenings. Business is slow. Almas the shopkeeper translates Bertrand Russell just to keep busy, one arm pinned with the red armband that police require all merchants to wear. Eli the ponytailed bookseller has run out of Uyghur books to sell. The novelist Perhat Tursun is there, wearily chain-smoking, his passport forever revoked. Foreign countries, he grumbles, are like “a woman I was in love with but couldn’t marry.” Izgil, working on his own plans to flee, holds back a final farewell. Anyone who knew would be in even greater danger. After a long-shot bureaucratic prayer releases their confiscated passports, Izgil and his family flee China in August 2017 to seek asylum in Washington, home to one of the United States’ largest Uyghur communities. The Urumqi convenience store is shuttered now; friends report that Almas and Eli have been arrested and sent to “study.” Pain and survivor’s guilt smolder beneath Izgil’s calm and careful prose, bursting into flame in his poems: “These days / are crowded with shattered horizons / shattered!” He now lives trapped in “the runaway season / when surrender hides deep in the suitcase / when noble doubts run over the weight limit.” In 2020, Izgil learns that Tursun has been sentenced to 16 years in prison. Desperate for news, he calls the novelist’s office. The woman who answers listens silently as he pleads for news, then hangs up without a word. Only then, Izgil writes, did he understand he’d truly lost his friend forever: “We will see these dear ones only in our dreams.” Dan Keane is a freelance writer based in New Zealand and a former senior lecturer at NYU Shanghai.

        "title": "Amazon Implements Transformative Measures to Enhance Grocery Business",
        "content": "August 2, 2023 Amazon, the e-commerce giant, is implementing a series of transformative measures to enhance its grocery business, as highlighted by Tony Hoggett, the head of the grocery division, in an interview with Bloomberg. These innovative changes encompass: 1. Allowing non-Prime members to place grocery orders, expanding accessibility to a wider customer base. 2. Streamlining the online grocery shopping experience by integrating the carts of Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh, and Amazon.com. This will offer customers a seamless and convenient purchasing process. 3. Shifting the focus away from the costly “Just Walk Out” system in physical stores. This move reflects Amazon’s commitment to refining its brick-and-mortar grocery strategy. These strategic adjustments align with Amazon’s ongoing endeavors to revitalize its presence in the grocery industry. In pursuit of a stronger market position, the company has been harnessing cutting-edge technology, exemplified by its cashierless grocery stores, to meet the evolving demands of consumers. Furthermore, Amazon has decided to temporarily halt the expansion of its Fresh and Go stores as part of this grocery strategy overhaul. Despite its e-commerce dominance, Amazon has faced challenges in establishing a successful grocery business.

        "content": "It’s almost time for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to report 2Q23 earnings, with the company slated to release its latest financial statement once the market action comes to a halt on Thursday (Aug 3). Like for many of its Big Tech brethren, it’s been a good year so far for the ecommerce giant, with shares up by 53% year-to-date. The positive market sentiment is acknowledged by Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter, who expects a “solid print for Q2 and a good guide for Q3.” Pachter, though, brings attention to the recent strong share price action, and therefore says his share price appreciation expectations “are capped.” Nevertheless, Pachter has raised his price target on AMZN to $146 (from $129), indicating the stock has room for further growth of ~14% from current levels. Pachter’s rating stays an Outperform (i.e., Buy). (To watch Pachter’s track record, click here) As for what to anticipate in the readout, the analyst expects Amazon to reap the benefits of an increase in overall macro sentiment during Q2, particularly in its advertising, online stores, and subscriptions segments. Meanwhile, AWS is predicted to remain flattish. Numbers wise, Pachter sees Q2 revenue hitting $131 billion, up from $127 billion in Q1 and above the midpoint of the guide ($127 – 133 billion). The consensus estimate aligns closely at $131.5 billion. Pachter thinks there could be over $2.2 billion in combined growth for online stores (at around $300 million), physical stores ($300 million), and third-party seller services ($1.6 billion), based on “recent sequential trends combined with an improving macro environment and upward pricing pressure.” Further growth of $800 million should come from ad services, while subscription services could post growth of $300 million. On the other hand, impacted by “market maturity,” other incumbents “buying market share,” and Amazon’s countering decision to cut pricing so to stay competitive, Amazon Web Services (AWS) will most probably “grow slowly.” As for the third quarter, Pachter sees the record sales notched during this year’s Prime Day event ensuring the guide could come in near to the Street’s expectations of $138 billion, which is just above Pachter’s Q3 forecast for revenue of $137 billion. Turning now to the rest of the Street, where Amazon is that rare beast – a stock with plenty of coverage and all of it positive. The stock’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on a unanimous 29 Buys. The average target stands at $152.52, representing one-year gains of ~19% from current levels.

        "title": "Competitive Advantage Definition With Types and Examples",
        "content": "What Is a Competitive Advantage? Competitive advantage refers to factors that allow a company to produce goods or services better or more cheaply than its rivals. These factors allow the productive entity to generate more sales or superior margins compared to its market rivals. Competitive advantages are attributed to a variety of factors including cost structure, branding, the quality of product offerings, the distribution network, intellectual property, and customer service. Investopedia / Michela Buttignol Understanding Competitive Advantage Competitive advantages generate greater value for a firm and its shareholders because of certain strengths or conditions. The more sustainable the competitive advantage, the more difficult it is for competitors to neutralize the advantage. The two main types of competitive advantages are comparative advantage and differential advantage. A comparative advantage is when a firm can produce products more efficiently and at a lower cost than its competitors. A differential advantage is when a firm's products or services differ from its competitors' offerings and are seen as superior. Advanced technology, patent-protected products or processes, superior personnel, and strong brand identity are all drivers of differential advantage. These factors support wide margins and large market shares. For example, Apple is famous for creating innovative products, such as the iPhone, and supporting its market leadership with savvy marketing campaigns to build an elite brand. Another example is major drug companies. They can market branded drugs at high price points because they are protected by patents. How To Build a Competitive Advantage To build a competitive advantage, a company can use one of three main methods: Cost: Provide offerings at the lowest price Differentiation: Provide offerings that are superior in quality, service, or features Specialization: Provide offerings narrowly tailored to a focused market Competing on price can be effective, but if you slash prices too much you risk decreasing profit margins to an untenable level. Many firms opt instead to differentiate themselves in other ways, which helps preserve or expand their profit margin. Benefits of a Competitive Advantage When a company creates a durable competitive advantage, it sets itself apart from the competition and provides value to customers as well as stakeholders. By producing a desirable product or service that is better or more cost-effective than its competitors,' the company can make more sales, generate more revenue, and enjoy greater profits. Strategies to Build a Competitive Advantage To build a competitive advantage, a company must know what sets it apart from its competitors and then focus its message, service, and products with that difference in mind. Here are several strategies companies use to build a competitive advantage: Research the market: Market research helps a company identify and define its target market, which can guide it in developing the most effective advantage. Identify strengths: A company can find its unique strengths, especially relative to competitors, by reviewing products, services, features, positioning, and branding. Evaluate finances: Companies can take a close look at their financial performance to spot profit centers and areas of stability, using financial statements and ratios. Review operations: How efficient is a company's operations? Where is it effective, and where is there room for improvement? Consider customer service as well as production and supply chain management. Consider human resources: The talent a company can attract as employees and leadership can make an important difference in the success of the business. Evaluating company culture, hiring, and staffing practices can help. Competitive Advantage vs. Comparative Advantage A firm's ability to produce a good or service more efficiently than its competitors, which leads to greater profit margins, creates a comparative advantage. Rational consumers will choose the cheaper of any two perfect substitutes offered. For example, a car owner will buy gasoline from a gas station that is 5 cents cheaper than other stations in the area. For imperfect substitutes, like Pepsi versus Coke, higher margins for the lowest-cost producers can eventually bring superior returns. Economies of scale, efficient internal systems, and geographic location can also create a comparative advantage. For example, a firm that manufactures a product in China may have lower labor costs than a company that manufactures in the U.S., so it can offer an equal product at a lower price. In the context of international trade economics, opportunity cost determines comparative advantages. Amazon (AMZN) is an example of a company focused on building and maintaining a comparative advantage. The e-commerce platform has a level of scale and efficiency that is difficult for retail competitors to replicate, allowing it to rise to prominence largely through price competition. How Do I Know If a Company Has a Competitive Advantage? If a business can increase its market share through increased efficiency or productivity, it would have a competitive advantage over its competitors. How Can a Company Increase Its Competitive Advantage? Lasting competitive advantages tend to be things competitors cannot easily replicate or imitate. Warren Buffet calls sustainable competitive advantages economic moats, which businesses can figuratively dig around themselves to entrench competitive advantages. This can include strengthening one's brand, raising barriers to new entrants (such as through regulations), and the defense of intellectual property. Why Do Larger Companies Often Have Competitive Advantages? Competitive advantages that accrue from economies of scale typically refer to supply-side advantages, such as the purchasing power of a large restaurant or retail chain. But advantages of scale also exist on the demand side—they are commonly referred to as network effects. This happens when a service becomes more valuable to all of its users as the service adds more users. The result can often be a winner-take-all dynamic in the industry. How Is Competitive Advantage Different From Comparative Advantage? Comparative advantage mostly refers to international trade. It posits that a country should focus on what it can produce and export relatively the cheapest—thus if one country has a competitive advantage in producing both products A & B, it should only produce product A if it can do it better than B and import B from some other country. The Bottom Line A company's competitive advantage is the way it excels compared to its rivals. This advantage may be through cost leadership, differentiation, or focus. Identifying a company's competitive advantage helps show how it is positioned to be more successful than its competitors, creating more revenue and generating greater profits."

        "content": "(Adds Amazon comments in paragraphs 7-9) By Daniel Wiessner Aug 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. workplace safety regulator said Amazon.com Inc has subjected workers at yet another of its sprawling warehouses to hazardous conditions by imposing onerous production quotas and failing to provide proper medical care. The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) on Thursday said workers at the Logan Township, New Jersey, warehouse suffered bodily stress that was causing muscular disorders and neck and back injuries. And Amazon failed to ensure that injured employees received adequate treatment, the agency said. OSHA said it had recommended $15,625 in penalties, which is the maximum fine allowed under U.S. law. Amazon has 15 days to either pay the fine or appeal to a review board. Since January, OSHA has levied about $150,000 in fines on Amazon for allegedly creating hazardous conditions or failing to record work-related injuries at several other warehouses across the country. Separately on Thursday, the Missouri Workers Center, a worker advocacy group, said it had filed a complaint with OSHA on behalf of employees at an Amazon warehouse near St. Louis, Missouri. They claim the online retailer imposes excessive, unsafe work rates and that they were mistreated by Amazon's in-house medical staff. \"OSHA's own prior citations show a pattern of safety violations throughout Amazon's warehouse network, a pattern which is unfortunately reflected in our own experiences,\" the workers said in the complaint. Amazon in a statement provided by a spokesperson said it takes worker safety seriously and plans to appeal the OSHA citation. The company said the rate of worker injuries recorded globally has improved significantly since 2019. Regarding the complaint filed in Missouri, Amazon said it welcomed OSHA inspectors at the \"clean, safe facility.\" The company said the injury rate at the Missouri warehouse is below the industry average and has improved more than 55% since 2019. Story continues \"The vast majority of employees at this facility say in anonymous surveys that they feel safe at work and believe their managers are always looking for ways to enhance safety further,\" Amazon said. Critics of Amazon have long accused the company of putting profit over safety by requiring employees to work at an unsafe pace and forgo breaks to meet demanding quotas. The company's safety record came under renewed scrutiny during the COVID-19 pandemic. Those concerns helped spur union campaigns at warehouses across the country, including one in New York City where workers voted to unionize last year.

Furthermore, I didn't buy into the idea that just because AWS was massive, this necessarily equated to Amazon's AI technology being a leading technology. And that was what the market had expected. However, what I had not counted on was that Amazon's retail operations would positively surprise so significantly on the upside.

However, it sits at a loss of 28.95% over the past year. Investors might therefore be wondering where the company will be headed in the future and if the rally in its share is set to continue. Get Amazon.com alerts: Much of that trajectory could come down to how its earnings are received when it publishes its result on Feb 2 next week. Let's look at what the future might have in store for the company. Is Amazon a buy ahead of earnings? Although attempting to time the market is generally unadvisable, the looming recession has been discussed extensively over the past six months, so a lower stock price for Amazon and its peer companies could be on the cards. Some warnings include overvaluation in stocks and commodities, a downward trend in the S&P 500 index, a worse-than-expected rebound of consumer spending in China, and China's real estate prices continuing to fall lower each month. These signs all point towards capitulation in the market being possible to be realized soon. Adding to the pessimism is that executives of Amazon itself may hold a bleak outlook for the future. Plans to let go over 18,000 employees were signed off by Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy this year. However, it's also important to frame these Amazon layoffs correctly. It might not signal that Amazon expects long-term weakness, but rather it could be more of a pivot toward reaching greater efficiency. The stock prices and payrolls of tech companies were severely bloated by COVID-19 stimulus money that would never last long-term. The unexpected turnaround of the virus that came quickly in January last year saw restrictions lift, and the money flowing into these stocks detoured in a different direction. How the layoffs could benefit Amazon Layoffs are needed when business conditions change and the company's experiments don't work as expected. Jassy told Amazon investors that it would lay the groundwork for the company to be more resourceful and instill some vigilance into its operations. This change in tact is a far cry from the splurge in spending seen when liquidity was at an all-time high.

Capital.com reported that many of the jobs axed were those in human resources and for its 'experiments' Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh, which did not turn out as expected. If the layoffs did not happen, Amazon might as well light some of its money paying those employees on fire. A large-scale hiring freeze is in place for most of the tech industry, and HR professionals looking over empty desks don't contribute to productivity. The mass layoffs might be one of the largest it has ever seen. But still, we were also in extraordinary and uncertain circumstances with no knowing precisely when the pandemic would reach its peak, and it did so rapidly over the first few weeks of 2022. Another argument is that for investors who can see past the immediate threats in front of them and hold Amazon for a decade or longer, it gives them a more attractive entry for scooping up Amazon shares. For better or worse, the market seems to focus on the here and now at the exclusion of everything else. So let's look at Amazon's potential upside for the future and beyond. Valuation Wall Street seems to have an overwhelming feeling of confidence about Amazon's share, despite it only having a moderate buy rating at the time of writing. 42 analysts who cover it rate it a buy, while it also has 2 hold and 2 sell ratings. One of the biggest things investors could feel confident about is its earnings per share (EPS) is expected to grow from 0.68 per share to $1.58 per share. That's an enormous growth of 132.35%, unheard of for a blue-chip stock in the FAANG acronym. Other positive aspects include that its MarketBeat consensus price target currently sits at $145.41, with analysts predicting that it has a 46.6% potential upside. Like other big names this week, investors will watch Amazon closely for guidance on the rest of the year. This may help to confirm some people's suspicions of the impending recession and its economic impact. Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon.com right now?

In the passenger seat, a black-clad man. In the back, a man in German uniform, groaning in agony. They arrive at a hospital where a sullen orderly with a flashlight in one hand and a switchblade in the other looks at the patient, then scoffs and spits at the woman’s request to help him. The man in black steps out of the car and opens his raincoat to reveal a priest’s collar. His garb is genuine. But the patient’s Nazi uniform is a disguise: He is in fact an escaped British prisoner. “Is there a dentist in that hospital behind you?” asks the priest. “Why?” replies the orderly. “Because you’ll need one in a minute when I punch your teeth through your skull.” Joseph O’Connor’s latest novel, “My Father’s House,” begins with a potent blend of excitement, suspense and intrigue. After making his mark with his grand entrance, O’Connor’s priest goes on to steal many more scenes by showing not just the courage of his convictions but also courage under fire. The result is a gripping World War II-set drama featuring the unlikeliest of heroes, one whom the reader roots for every step of the way. WpGet the full experience.Choose your plan ArrowRight 5 historical novels that transport readers German forces have occupied Rome. Obersturmbannführer Paul Hauptmann’s iron grip on the city is a stranglehold that restricts freedom of movement and expression. He is informed that Adolf Hitler is furious that increasing numbers of Allied prisoners and Jews are escaping camps throughout Italy. Most are heading to the capital in a bid to seek sanctuary in Vatican City — the world’s smallest state and, more important, a neutral enclave and independent safe zone within Rome. Hauptmann believes that a “nuisance of a priest” is involved with an escape line and instructs his deputy to take necessary action: “Let’s get this weed uprooted.” Advertisement The Gestapo chief’s suspicions are correct. Monsignor Hugh O’Flaherty, Irish envoy to the Vatican, has assembled a ragtag group to spirit to safety those fleeing Nazi persecution. To cover their tracks, they form a choir and meet once a week for “rehearsal.” At each session, while harboring the ever-present fear of being betrayed, they go over and commit to memory the latest operational plans, escape routes, safe houses and false identities. In case the walls have ears, they speak in code — escapees collectively are “The Library,” individual fugitives “Books,” their hiding places “Shelves.” If that code is cracked, and if the group is compromised, then Nazi repercussions will be swift, brutal and far-reaching. 10 books to read in January Every so often a chorister is required to go out and perform a “solo.” When news trickles in that a Nazi invasion of the Vatican is imminent, O’Flaherty devises a mission for group member Enzo Angelucci to carry out on the night of Christmas Eve, 1943. At the 11th hour, Angelucci, who has the right attitude but insufficient expertise, panics and drops out. Rather than abort, O’Flaherty takes his place. But just as he is making progress, he turns a corner and is brought to an abrupt stop by Hauptmann and his Luger. O’Connor has written several novels based on real Irish people. His 2010 book, “Ghost Light,” chronicled the love affair between a young actress and the playwright John Millington Synge. O’Connor returned to the theatrical world for his last novel, the bravura “Shadowplay” (2019), which traced the relationship between Dracula’s creator, Bram Stoker, and two main players on the Victorian stage. Advertisement “My Father’s House” sees the Dublin-born writer once again turning fact into fiction. The novel is inspired by the true story of O’Flaherty and his associates, whose daring exploits saved lives and changed outcomes. O’Connor’s narrative charts the buildup and countdown to their mission, and O’Flaherty’s attempt to execute it. Woven around these two main threads are colorful testimonies from all eight choristers. They display a range of singular voices and absorbing backstories that flesh out each character. What to read in 2023 These include a British ambassador, a Dutch journalist and an Italian candle seller. Delia, the wife of an Irish diplomat, infuses her account with dry wit: “I was singing in Belfast the night the Luftwaffe firebombed the theatre,” she explains. “That’s what you call a mixed review.” Giovanna, a widowed countess, finds a new purpose and the will to live when she rallies to O’Flaherty’s cause. John May from London is a rough diamond and smooth operator who doesn’t suffer fools: “Once bitten, twice bite, that’s my motto.” Sign up for the Book World newsletter For a while, the book feels like an ensemble piece. However, O’Flaherty (or as May calls him, “Hughdini”) emerges as the star of the show. O’Connor brings vividly to life a man who, despite his calling, stands up to be counted after witnessing Nazi atrocities. His cat-and-mouse game with Hauptmann is expertly plotted; his desperate mission through the streets of Rome is brilliantly paced. It is hard not to be captivated by his presence throughout this hugely satisfying book, from its explosive opening to its bittersweet end.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Kandis Westmore in Oakland said the 2021 lawsuit, which alleges the online retailer's hourly quotas place older workers at a higher risk of injury, was too vague and failed to identify specific policies that are discriminatory. \"Simply because physical strength declines with age does not automatically mean that older workers are more likely to get injured or fail to keep up with the quotas,\" Westmore wrote. Amazon spokesperson Barbara Agrait in a statement said the claim that the company imposes quotas on workers was a misconception, and employees are able to take informal breaks during their shifts to stretch or use the bathroom. \"We do not require employees to meet specific productivity speeds or targets,\" Agrait said. \"We assess performance based on safe and achievable expectations.\" Lawyers for the plaintiff did not respond to a request for comment. The lawsuit says Amazon requires warehouse employees to move 150 to 300 items through their work posts each hour, depending on their job duties. Workers can be disciplined or fired for missing quotas or spending too much time off task. The lawsuit claimed that because workers who are 49 and older are more susceptible to injuries, including those resulting from highly repetitive motions, the quotas amount to age discrimination in violation of California law. Westmore in granting Amazon's motion to dismiss the case said it would be improper to infer that older workers are more likely to be injured merely because of their age. Amazon has been criticized by employees, lawmakers and union organizers for putting profits over worker safety by enforcing the production quotas. Last week, the U.S. workplace safety regulator said it had cited Amazon for placing workers at three warehouses at risk by exposing them to ergonomic hazards that resulted in serious injuries. Amazon, which faces up to $60,000 in fines, has said it invests hundreds of millions of dollars annually to ensure worker safety.

Ask This Question First.\n内容: Retail is a tough business in any economic climate. A small number of retailers -- think Costco (NASDAQ: COST) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) -- manage to build up durable competitive advantages over the course of decades. Most retailers aren&#039;t so lucky. Right now, many retail stocks look surprisingly cheap based on trailing earnings. Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (NYSE: BBY) goes for around 13 times earnings, department store Macy&#039;s (NYSE: M) trades for less than 5 times earnings, and grocery chain Kroger (NYSE: KR) changes hands for roughly 14 times earnings. Those are not particularly optimistic valuation multiples. Valuation has its limits With persistently high inflation and rising interest rates pressuring consumer spending, retailers in general are likely in for a rough and unpredictable 2023. Even the strongest retailers are starting to face headwinds. Walmart (NYSE: WMT), for example, suffered a gross margin decline in the third quarter of 2022 and guided for a drop in adjusted earnings for the full fiscal year. Many retailers will see their margins contract this year as consumers pull back on spending. While Macy&#039;s stock may look extremely inexpensive, for example, it&#039;s probably not as cheap as it looks. Analysts are expecting a modest decline in earnings for the company in the upcoming fiscal year, but that could turn out to be far too optimistic. It&#039;s a similar story with Best Buy. Despite tumbling demand for PCs and smartphones, analysts still expect a small increase in Best Buy&#039;s earnings per share in the upcoming fiscal year. Color me skeptical. Deciding whether or not to invest in a retailer based on past earnings is problematic for two reasons. First, because the past is the past, and second, because the past few years have been pretty weird. An unprecedented shutdown of the economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 was followed by a period of booming demand and free-flowing stimulus. None of that was normal, so basing investment decisions on a retailer&#039;s results during that time doesn&#039;t make a ton of sense. Basing investment decisions on analyst estimates for future earnings is problematic because analysts are often wrong, and sometimes very wrong. Analyst estimates can be useful, but they certainly shouldn&#039;t form the foundation of anyone&#039;s investing process. The most important question When I consider investing in a retailer, I naturally take into account valuation, earnings, and growth. But the most important question I ask is this: If the retailer disappeared from the face of the Earth tomorrow, would consumers really care? Amazon: Yes, consumers would definitely care. There are plenty of e-commerce alternatives, but none of them have anywhere close to the product selection of Amazon. People order from Amazon because it&#039;s easy, and no other retailer has replicated that. Costco: Yes. While whether shopping at Costco actually saves you money depends on how prone you are to impulse purchases and overspending, consumers certainly believe that the company saves them money. Costco&#039;s membership renewal rates are above 90%. Best Buy: I&#039;d say yes, but not nearly as strongly compared Amazon or Costco. Best Buy has transformed itself over the past decade partly by putting a renewed focus on customer service. That&#039;s the company&#039;s big differentiator, and it&#039;s the reason why the retailer holds a somewhat unique place in the U.S. retail market. Macy&#039;s: No. There&#039;s nothing special about Macy&#039;s. There are surely some loyal customers out there, but that&#039;s true of every retailer. Macy&#039;s finds itself operating in a portion of the department store industry that has little reason to exist. It&#039;s not focused on low prices and value like Kohl&#039;s or even Target, and it doesn&#039;t have the cachet of a higher-end department store like Nordstrom. Kroger: The grocery business has become concentrated among a small number of megachains, so for that reason, consumers would probably care. But in the grocery industry, I like specialized chains like Sprouts that people shop at for reasons other than it being the closest store to their homes. None of this is to say that the best retailers on this list will definitely be great investments, or that the worst retailers on this list will definitely be duds. But if you want the odds to be in your favor, stick with retailers that have some sort of edge, and that customers genuinely like. 10 stocks we like better than Macy&#039;s When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This brings Amazon’s total portfolio to more than 20 GW—that could generate the amount of energy to power 5.3 million U.S. homes—across 401 renewable energy projects in 22 countries. The company’s renewable energy purchases continue to add new wind and solar projects on the grids that power Amazon’s operations, including Amazon Web Services (AWS) data centers, Amazon fulfillment centers, and physical stores around the world. With these continued investments, Amazon set a new corporate record for the most renewable energy announced by a single company in one year. The company remains the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy—a position it’s held since 2020, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Amazon’s continued investment in renewable energy helps to accelerate growth in new regions through innovative deal structures, technologies, and cloud solutions. These purchases also bring Amazon closer to powering its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025—five years ahead of its original 2030 target. In 2022, the company announced new projects in Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Poland, Singapore, Spain, and the U.S., and broke ground in Brazil, India, and Indonesia. With 25 new renewable energy projects secured to close out the year, the company now has 401 projects globally, including 164 wind farms and solar farms, and 237 rooftop solar projects on Amazon facilities. Once operational, Amazon’s global renewable energy projects are expected to generate 56,881 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of clean energy each year. “As we continue to launch new renewable energy projects around the world, we’re pleased to be on track to power our operations with 100% renewable energy, five years ahead of our original target. With 133 projects in 11 countries announced in 2022, Amazon had another record year,” said Adam Selipsky, CEO of AWS. “These projects highlight the diversity of our renewable energy sources and showcase our ability to bring new technologies to new markets and further reduce the impacts of climate change.” In addition to the 108 clean energy projects the company announced in 2022, Amazon today is announcing 25 additional 2022 clean energy projects. These include: Eleven new projects in Europe, including Finland, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, totaling 372 megawatts (MW) of capacity. Tapping into one of the world’s best renewable energy resources, Amazon continued to add to its portfolio of offshore wind projects, investing in two new offshore wind projects in Europe totaling 280 MW of capacity. Four new projects in North America, totaling 918 MW of energy in Arizona, California, and Texas. A new solar project paired with energy storage in California allows Amazon to store clean energy produced by its solar projects and deploy it when solar energy is not available, such as in the evening hours, or during periods of high demand. Also in California, Amazon added its first on-site solar project at the Amazon Air Hub, where employees pack and handle freight and conduct planeside operations. Ten new renewable energy projects in India, Indonesia, and Japan. In India, a third 200 MW wind-solar hybrid project was added to Amazon’s first two wind-solar hybrid projects. Renewable hybrid energy systems can play a key role in helping India accelerate the decarbonization of power generation, lowering the cost of electricity in the medium term. These hybrid energy systems also maximize clean energy use on the grid by combining two technologies with different generation profiles, reducing variability in renewable generation, and improving grid stability. In Indonesia, Amazon invested in its first renewable energy projects, securing a first-of-its-kind agreement for corporations to access additional utility-scale solar projects. In Japan, Amazon added three on-site solar projects and a new 38 MW utility-scale solar project. Rapidly scaling renewable energy is one of the most effective strategies to fight climate change. To ensure organizations’ renewable energy purchases have the greatest impact on emissions reductions, Amazon recently led the creation of the new Emissions First coalition. This coalition is leading advocacy efforts to modernize the world’s leading carbon-accounting standard, helping to reduce carbon from global electricity grids as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. \"Amazon&#039;s clean energy portfolio doesn&#039;t just top the corporate charts—it is now among the leading utilities globally, as well,” said Kyle Harrison, head of sustainability research at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. “The fact that it announced a new annual record of clean energy in a year mired by a global energy crisis, supply chain bottlenecks and high interest rates speaks to its forward planning and expertise in navigating power markets and executing long-term contracts.\" “Amidst the market uncertainty of 2022, Amazon led clean energy buyers and doubled down on its commitment to renewable energy,” said Miranda Ballentine, CEO of Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA). “Amazon’s commitment to decarbonization is demonstrated through its leading placement on CEBA’s Deal Tracker Top 10, within our member community, and on a global scale.” “As Asia continues to transition away from coal and gas, these investments by Amazon in wind and solar are further evidence that there is a large and growing corporate renewable electricity demand in this region. We look forward to continuing to work with Amazon and our other ACEC members to rapidly increase the supply of renewables and to achieve our shared 100% renewable ambitions in the region,” said Sam Kimmins, director of energy at Climate Group and Asia Clean Energy Coalition (ACEC) spokesperson. Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge in 2019, committing to reach net-zero carbon by 2040—10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. The Pledge now has nearly 400 signatories, including Best Buy, IBM, Microsoft, PepsiCo, Siemens, Unilever, Verizon, and Visa. Amazon continues to transform its transportation network, including electrifying its delivery fleet and sourcing alternatives to fossil fuels—it currently has thousands of electric delivery vehicles from Rivian in more than 100 cities and regions in the U.S., more than 3,000 electric vans delivering packages to customers in Europe, and several electric vehicle partnerships in APAC. The company is also investing $2 billion in the development of decarbonizing services and solutions through The Climate Pledge Fund.

Zurich will use AWS’s reliable global infrastructure, advanced analytics, and machine learning technologies to deliver new digital customer experiences and drive automation at scale, in support of its worldwide digital strategy. As part of the multiyear strategic collaboration, Zurich will move 1,000 applications to AWS by 2025, including core insurance and SAP workloads. Zurich will move its critical applications to AWS, simplifying, modernizing, and automating the company’s infrastructure. This approach will provide flexible and scalable application environments, enabling agile product development. Using Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon Aurora (AWS’s fully managed MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database built for the cloud), and AWS App Runner (AWS’s service to quickly deploy containerized web applications and APIs), Zurich will develop and bring new products to market quicker, saving approximately $30 million a year. As a result, Zurich can focus on innovation and new customer experiences, reinvesting valuable resources into new business opportunities, recruitment, and acquisition strategies. By embracing cloud technologies, Zurich will also be able to streamline and optimize its core business processes and better prepare for new reporting requirements in 2023, including alignment with international financial reporting standards—IFRS 9 and IFRS 17. Zurich will use RISE with SAP on AWS, a fully managed offering that combines SAP’s solution and implementation experience with AWS&#039; experience in helping customers transform their SAP landscapes on the cloud. By migrating its SAP environment to AWS, Zurich will create a modern, cloud-based system connecting data across its entire business. The SAP workloads migration will consist of 20 landscapes, a collection of servers for a specific workload, including more than 100 individual systems such as human resources (HR) and finance. AWS’s extensive SAP experience will allow Zurich to increase the performance of its SAP applications and integrate its data with advanced analytics and machine learning services to gain predictive capabilities and enterprise-wide reporting. Zurich works with AWS Skills Guild, a comprehensive skills enablement program that helps organizations accelerate cloud outcomes by creating excitement, increasing employee engagement, and nurturing a culture of learning. The insurance provider has already trained more than 400 employees, with plans to further grow the program. Zurich offers skills development opportunities to help attract and train new employee talent, and accelerate cloud adoption across the company. “We want to help our retail customers lead safer and healthier lives, and bring our business customers peace of mind, by using the power of digital technologies to meet their evolving needs,” said Zurich’s Ericson Chan, Group Chief Information and Digital Officer. “Working with AWS will transform the way we bring solutions to market and enable us to make the most accurate and up-to-date insights available to our customers. We look forward to using the new AWS Region in Switzerland to support our regulatory reporting requirements.” “Zurich’s focus on customers and innovation over the last 150 years is why it remains a leading insurer for more than 55 million people and businesses around the world. Moving their most critical business applications to AWS allows Zurich to put data at the heart of its business to automate processes, increase efficiency, and improve customer responsiveness,” said Matt Garman, senior vice president of Sales, Marketing, and Global Services at Amazon Web Services. “Combining Zurich’s financial expertise with AWS’s broad functionality will help the insurer continue to evolve its business to anticipate customer needs, and provide more personalized insurance products.” About Amazon Web Services Since 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud.

Amazon will report its 4Q-22 earnings on Thursday, February 2, 2023, and I believe the eCommerce company has a good chance of exceeding low profit expectations. I also believe that the outlook for 1Q-23 could be better than expected, and that too much negativity is currently priced into Amazon's valuation. Because the company's stock has a compelling sales valuation, it's a buy both before and after Amazon reports fourth-quarter earnings next week. Earnings Expectations Are Way Too Low If I had to bet on whether Amazon will beat profit estimates for 4Q-22, I would bet that the company will fly past earnings estimates because profit expectations are irrationally low.

Read full disclaimer. What should you look for in a powerline adapter? Speed should be your top priority. Electrical wiring is unshielded, so there can be a lot of interference slowing down the connection between adapters. Get a powerline kit with a high transmission rate if you can—you’ll probably see a quarter of that speed at the most, so the higher, the better. You should also consider adapters with pass-through electrical sockets so you don’t lose an outlet when you plug an adaptor into the wall. The sockets are filtered too, meaning your connected device won’t add more electrical noise than what you already have plaguing your home’s wiring. Best overall—TP-Link TL-PA9020P Best overall View on Amazon *Amazon.com Price (as of 1/18/23 09:06 MST). Read full disclaimer. We like that both adapters in the TL-PA9020P kit have dual Gigabit Ethernet ports, especially on the router end, since you lose a LAN port to the adapter. The kit has a great max transmission rate too, but your top speed depends on your home’s wiring and everything connected to it. Theoretically, the kit has a range of up to 984 feet, but your walls and ceilings can hide a lot of length, so the practical distance may be shorter than you think. You can pair up to 16 adapters within that range if you need to expand your connections. Pros: Dual Gigabit Ethernet ports Pass-through outlet Cons: No Wi-Fi connectivity Side-mounter LEDs Best for budgets—TP-Link TL-PA7017P Best for budgets View on Amazon *Amazon.com Price (as of 1/18/23 09:06 MST). Read full disclaimer. This powerline adapter kit is a watered-down version of the TP-Link TL-PA9020P kit listed above. It has half the transmission rate and half the Gigabit Ethernet ports for about half the cost. It should be plenty if you need a smidge more speed in areas where Wi-Fi can’t reach. Like with the TL-PA9020P kit, you can create a single TL-PA7017P powerline network with up to 16 nodes—you can even mix and match compatible TP-Link HomePlug AV2 powerline adapters. Also, the built-in pass-through socket is filtered, so no worries about adding extra electrical noise that can disrupt your powerline network. Pros: Great price Pass-through outlet Cons: Lackluster speed No Wi-Fi connectivity Best for speed—Zyxel PLA6456BB Best for speed View on Amazon *Amazon.com Price (as of 1/18/23 09:06 MST). Read full disclaimer. Zyxel’s powerline kit has the fastest transmission speeds on our list, thanks to its use of the newer Gigabit Home Networking (G.hn) standard, which theoretically enables speeds up to 2,400 Mbps. In real-world use cases, you may see 600 Mbps tops, and that’s the best you’ll probably get from networking across noisy power lines until the technology improves. Other callouts include its impressive range, easy plug-and-play setup, and included pass-through electrical socket, which prevents you from losing a power connection. The adapter’s power-saving feature claims to reduce power consumption by up to 90% by going into standby mode automatically when the adapter idles. Pros: Fast speeds Best range Cons: No Wi-Fi Lower node count Best for Wi-Fi—TP-Link TL-WPA7617 Best for Wi-Fi View on Amazon *Amazon.com Price (as of 1/18/23 09:06 MST). Read full disclaimer. We generally don’t like to suggest powerline kits with Wi-Fi because you’d probably be better off with a traditional Wi-Fi extender. But if you can’t or don’t want to use Ethernet or Wi-Fi to widen your home network, TP-Link’s TL-WPA7617 kit is here to help. At first glance, the adapter seems best for IoT devices because real-world powerline speeds are slow, and the Wi-Fi 5 standard is outdated. The big callout here is OneMesh compatibility and how the adapter chooses the best connection (Wi-Fi or powerline) to receive and send data to the router. To get the most out of this kit, you need a compatible TP-Link OneMesh router. Also, keep in mind that you’ll lose a wall plug since the Wi-Fi unit doesn’t have a pass-through socket (but the router-side unit does). Pros: AC1300 Wi-Fi access OneMesh support Cons: Single pass-thru socket High price Best nano kit—TRENDnet TPL-422E2K Best nano kit View on Amazon *Amazon.com Price (as of 1/18/23 09:06 MST). Read full disclaimer. If you don’t need pass-through sockets on your powerline adapters, TRENDnet’s TPL-422E2K starter kit should be ideal. It’s a bit more expensive than Zyxel’s kit, which packs more speed and longer range, but the compact design of each unit keeps them inconspicuous—great for offices. This kit’s theoretical speed is middling compared to other TP-Link kits. However, it supports only up to eight units in a single powerline network, where other powerline kits support up to 16. But theoretically, you could pair this kit with any other powerline adapter based on the HomePlug AV standard. Pros: Compact design Easy installation Cons: No Wi-Fi connectivity No pass-thru sockets Powerline network adapter specs and features All powerline adapters have the same mission: extend your home network using existing electrical wiring. As a result, they have nearly identical features across the board. Here are a few specifics to look for when shopping for a new kit. Speed The higher the transfer rate, the better. Electrical wiring wasn’t designed to deliver data, so there’s no shielding to reduce interference. If a powerline adapter has a theoretical transfer rate of 2,000 Mbps, you may see a quarter of that speed at most between two units. Your real-world speed depends on your electrical wiring, the power outlets, the devices you have plugged in, and the circuit breakers. Pass-through power outlet Get a powerline adapter with a pass-through socket if you’re in a space where power outlets are in high demand. These sockets let you keep the same number of working power outlets while maintaining your wired internet connections. Generally, these powerline adapters plug into the bottom socket on a wall outlet. But their size may prevent you from plugging a power connector with a ground prong (like desktop power cables) into the top socket. You should be fine with plugs without the third prong. Gigabit Ethernet All powerline adapters listed here have at least one Gigabit Ethernet port. In the typical scenario, you plug one adapter into a router and the other adapter into a wired device. You don’t want a Fast Ethernet port on an adapter, which has a max speed of 100 Mbps versus 1,000 Mbps with Gigabit Ethernet. Since you want the most out of your connection, Gigabit Ethernet is best. Shopping around for new internet? Enter your zip code below to see which providers are available in your area. Our verdict It’s hard to pick our favorite blade of grass, and that’s what it feels like while selecting the best powerline adapter. They all look identical and do the same thing. But TP-Link’s TL-PA9020P kit hits that “just right” sweet spot in our book. We like the extra Gigabit Ethernet port, especially on the router side, so you don’t lose a LAN port. The speed is decent, and the pass-through socket is a great extra. Get the TP-Link TL-PA9020P kit FAQ about powerline network adapters Who should use powerline networking? Use a powerline adapter if most of your home network works fine, but you need a more reliable, wired connection for one or two devices. For example, a powerline connection would be great for the PC in your basement that never gets a reliable Wi-Fi signal. However, powerline networking isn’t a replacement for wiring your home with Ethernet if you need a bunch of fast wired connections. Why don’t I see the advertised speeds? Your home’s electrical wiring isn’t designed to deliver data. The wires don’t have shielding to block all the electrical noise interfering with connections between adapters. Plus, your real-world speeds depend on how your home is wired (copper vs. aluminum), the electrical system’s age, wall outlet types, and installed circuit breakers. You may find that sticking with Wi-Fi 6 is a far better option than powerline. Check out our picks for the best Wi-Fi 6 routers you can get. What interferes with powerline transmissions? Anything that causes electrical noise reduces transmission speeds between powerline adapters. Here’s a list of examples: Appliances Power supplies (device chargers) Surge protectors Fluorescent lights Light dimmers How do I improve my powerline network’s performance? We put together a list of Dos and Don’ts so you can get the most out of your powerline network: Do Don’t Plug adapters directly into a wall socket Keep adapters on the same circuit Unplug nearby device chargers Keep adapters away from appliances Plug an adapter into a power strip Plug an adapter into a surge protector Plug an adapter into an extension cord Plug in an adapter near an appliance Plug an adapter into an AFCI outlet Plug an adapter into a GFCI outlet Share outlets with fluorescent lights HomePlug vs. G.hn: What’s the difference? Both are networking standards used to deliver data across a medium. The HomePlug standard primarily focuses on electrical wiring, whereas Gigabit Home Networking (G.hn) adds support for coax cable, telephone lines, and Ethernet cables. HomePlug AV2 was introduced in 2011 and is still widely used in powerline products, although the older HomePlug Alliance is now inactive. The G.hn Wave 2 standard—developed by the International Telecommunication Union—arrived in 2016 and is expected to be succeeded by Wave 3 in 2023. What does “use the same circuit” mean? Some homes may have more than one circuit breaker box. For example, there may be one feeding the main house and one feeding a garage turned into a three-room rental. Keep the powerline adapters connected to the same circuit breaker box. You may even see the best performance from adapters on the same circuit breaker.

Here's what investors need to know before the announcement. Analysts estimate that Amazon.com will report an earnings per share (EPS) of $0.19. Amazon.com bulls will hope to hear the company announce they've not only beaten that estimate, but also to provide positive guidance, or forecasted growth, for the next quarter. New investors should note that it is sometimes not an earnings beat or miss that most affects the price of a stock, but the guidance (or forecast). Historical Earnings Performance Last quarter the company beat EPS by $0.06, which was followed by a 6.8% drop in the share price the next day. Here's a look at Amazon.com's past performance and the resulting price change: Quarter Q3 2022 Q2 2022 Q1 2022 Q4 2021 EPS Estimate 0.22 0.13 0.40 0.18 EPS Actual 0.28 0.18 0.37 0.29 Price Change % -6.8% 10.36% -14.05% 13.54% Stock Performance Shares of Amazon.com were trading at $103.13 as of January 30. Over the last 52-week period, shares are down 25.82%. Given that these returns are generally negative, long-term shareholders are likely bearish going into this earnings release.

The problem is that the cure-all potion commonly known as MMS is, in essence, industrial grade bleach. And selling this toxic and sometimes deadly chemical concoction as medicine is illegal.\n\n---\n\n[2023-02-01] 2023-02-01 10:28:00\n标题: Amazon's Ring Is Building A Mini Security Drone That Can Fly Around Your House\n内容: Ring revolutionized the home security industry with its namesake doorbell. The startup initially catapulted to mainstream attention after it showed up on the popular startup investing show “Shark Tank.” It originally was called Doorbot but rebranded to Ring shortly after its “Shark Tank” debut. The startup didn’t get an investment from any sharks, but it did manage to get acquired by Amazon.com Inc. AMZN for $1 billion. Since it’s been under the Amazon umbrella, Ring has released a number of new and innovative solutions. Recently, Ring released its new dashcam, which contains many of the same features as its doorbell. It’s also released several other products like smart lighting and door locks. What happened: Ring’s next-generation product, while still on-brand, is a bit less traditional. The company plans to release a mini security drone that can fly around your house. Users can program the drone to fly along custom paths to see what is happening around their house anytime from anywhere. If, for example, your front door alarm is triggered, the drone will undock and fly to the area to see what’s going on. Using the drone's built-in video camera, you can monitor anything that's happening from your phone. While the product won’t be available until at least 2024, this isn’t a vanity project or reach goal. The product is available for users by invitation. This shouldn’t be surprising because home security products are becoming incredibly advanced. MaxTracker, for example, is a startup integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into its security products. The startup creates small GPS trackers about the size of a thick credit card. The trackers have a battery life of up to a year and can use AI to distinguish between a bike being stolen versus getting knocked over or an older person falling down versus dropping their tracker. MaxTracker is raising funds to develop its products, meaning anyone can invest in the company for a limited time. Similarly, Amazon has been developing drone technology for years. It began testing Prime Air in 2013 but didn’t begin rolling out the program commercially until November. Amazon has had years of perfecting the technology, so it’s likely there will be further integrations of drone technology into the Amazon suite of products.\n\n---\n\n[2023-02-01] 2023-02-01 11:00:00\n标题: Dragon Glassware® releases Astronaut Glasses\n内容: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Feb. 1, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The twenty-first century space race is on and while NASA prepares its next moon landing and mission to Mars, Dragon Glassware is excited to cheer the NASA team on from the ground with the launch of their new Astronaut Glasses!

While that was true at the time of his death, he had been in office for under four months when he was shot. On July 2, 1881, President James Garfield was in a good mood. Having completed a few months in office, Gaffy, as at least one of his friends called him, was going on vacation. It was a welcome break from the presidency, which Garfield found tedious and depressing. After doing a handspring over a bed in the White House, the 49-year-old president headed to the Baltimore and Potomac railroad station. He was accompanied by Secretary of State James Blaine — and no security. While waiting for the train, he was suddenly shot twice and fell to the ground. Though he survived the initial incident, Garfield would ultimately succumb to his wounds a few months later. The killer, Charles Guiteau, was delusional and obsessive, a stalker who believed that murdering Garfield would save the Republican Party. He was also a former member of a New York utopian colony, the Oneida Community. WpGet the full experience.Choose your plan ArrowRight Like that once-famous colony, Garfield’s untimely death has been largely forgotten today, but both take on central roles in Susan Wels’s book “An Assassin in Utopia: The True Story of a Nineteenth-Century Sex Cult and a President’s Murder.” Wels has exhaustively researched the assassination and all the factors leading up to it, especially Guiteau’s association with Oneida. Packed with colorful characters and well-chosen details, this book is an engrossing — if at times too wide-ranging — account of Victorian-era American eccentricity. ‘Booth’ imagines the dysfunctional family that created John Wilkes Booth From the outside, the Oneida Community looked idyllic. Led by the preacher John Humphrey Noyes, it was the most successful utopian colony of the period, spanning more than 30 years. At its height, tourists flocked to what Wels describes as the “wild woodland” in Upstate New York, with orchards, livestock, “whizzing mills” and women with “queer cropped hair and shamelessly short skirts.” But behind the facade, Oneida’s free-love philosophies descended into pedophilia, incest and experiments in eugenics. The colony’s bizarre sexual beliefs naturally make for some of the most interesting reading in the book, as Wels knows how to paint a picture without being salacious or distasteful. Guiteau, who joined Oneida at age 19, was no doubt attracted to the colony’s erotic reputation. Unfortunately for him, the women wanted nothing to do with him and mockingly called him “Git Out.” “Sexual frustration, in fact, was the main cause of Guiteau’s misery,” Wels writes, as he “whined about his lack of access to Oneida’s women.” Still, he believed he was a great man in the making, destined to be “famous in this world.” Advertisement His narcissistic aspirations contrast sharply with Garfield’s waning ambitions. As a senator, former Civil War general and family man, Garfield seemed, by middle age, to be content with his life. No one was more shocked than he was when he emerged from the Republican convention as the presidential nominee. Instead of touring the country, he campaigned from the front porch of his Ohio farm, attracting trainloads of visitors. He seemed dismayed when he won. “He had accidentally attained the presidency,” Wels writes, “without the fire and vision for it that drove other candidates.” Share this articleShare Wels has a knack for making connections between disparate facts and coincidences. A hearse “ominously trapped” in Garfield’s inauguration parade becomes, in her hands, sad foreshadowing. Ties to Oneida surrounded the presidency. Roscoe Conkling, Garfield’s biggest political enemy, was a former district attorney in Oneida County and called “the giant of Oneida.” Garfield’s predecessor, Rutherford B. Hayes, was Noyes’s cousin. (Strangely, Hayes’s contentious election, with voter suppression, fraud accusations and simmering violence, had eerie parallels to the 2020 election.) In another coincidence, Abraham Lincoln’s son Robert was at the train station and saw Garfield’s shooting. It was the second presidential assassination he witnessed, having been at his father’s side as he died in 1865. That year, when speaking on Lincoln’s death, Garfield had said he didn’t believe it was “in the American character to become assassins.” In Jon Meacham’s biography, Lincoln is a guiding light for our times At times, Wels seems too caught up in her own research. Large portions of the book cover figures like Margaret Fuller and P.T. Barnum who are only tangentially connected to the story. “An Assassin in Utopia” also touches on a cross-dressing female Civil War spy, the spiritualist Fox sisters, the New York cholera pandemic, the history of the graham cracker, and the beliefs and ill-fated political career of newspaper publisher Horace Greeley — just to name a few threads. Throughout, Guiteau lurks in the background, growing increasingly unhinged as he drifts from one scheme to the next. Unfortunately he’s too thin and uninteresting a character to absorb all the detours, so it’s easy to lose track of why you’re reading about, say, the origins of Greeley, Colo., a place where neither Garfield nor Guiteau set foot. The upside of this approach is that by the time I got to the assassination, I was thoroughly immersed in 1880s Washington, with its shabby White House engulfed in the “stench of sewage rising out of malarial mud flats” outside. The ending is a page turner as Wels describes Garfield’s last days alive, oblivious to Guiteau skulking in the shadows. I felt real sympathy for the charismatic, reluctant president. “An Assassin in Utopia” may not stay focused on the story its title promises, but it does succeed in humanizing Garfield and the tragedy of his early death. “I am bidding goodbye to the freedom of private life, and to a long series of happy years,” Garfield wrote at the beginning of his term, unaware of how true those words would turn out to be.

(AMZN) on Thursday reported fourth-quarter profit of $278 million. On a per-share basis, the Seattle-based company said it had profit of 3 cents. Earnings, adjusted for non-recurring costs, came to 21 cents per share. The results surpassed Wall Street expectations.

The online retailer posted revenue of $149.2 billion in the period, also exceeding Street forecasts. Thirteen analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $145.37 billion. For the current quarter ending in March, Amazon said it expects revenue in the range of $121 billion to $126 billion. Analysts surveyed by Zacks had expected revenue of $121.33 billion. Amazon shares have risen 34% since the beginning of the year, while the S&P's 500 index has risen almost 9%.

        "title": "Can Amazon Recover Amid Tech Stock Sell-off?",
        "content": "Amazon.com Inc NASDAQ: AMZN has rallied over the past month, gaining 19.48%. However, it sits at a loss of 28.95% over the past year. Investors might therefore be wondering where the company will be headed in the future and if the rally in its share is set to continue. Get Amazon.com alerts: Much of that trajectory could come down to how its earnings are received when it publishes its result on Feb 2 next week. Let's look at what the future might have in store for the company. Is Amazon a buy ahead of earnings? Although attempting to time the market is generally unadvisable, the looming recession has been discussed extensively over the past six months, so a lower stock price for Amazon and its peer companies could be on the cards. Some warnings include overvaluation in stocks and commodities, a downward trend in the S&P 500 index, a worse-than-expected rebound of consumer spending in China, and China's real estate prices continuing to fall lower each month. These signs all point towards capitulation in the market being possible to be realized soon. Adding to the pessimism is that executives of Amazon itself may hold a bleak outlook for the future. Plans to let go over 18,000 employees were signed off by Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy this year. However, it's also important to frame these Amazon layoffs correctly. It might not signal that Amazon expects long-term weakness, but rather it could be more of a pivot toward reaching greater efficiency. The stock prices and payrolls of tech companies were severely bloated by COVID-19 stimulus money that would never last long-term. The unexpected turnaround of the virus that came quickly in January last year saw restrictions lift, and the money flowing into these stocks detoured in a different direction. How the layoffs could benefit Amazon Layoffs are needed when business conditions change and the company's experiments don't work as expected. Jassy told Amazon investors that it would lay the groundwork for the company to be more resourceful and instill some vigilance into its operations. This change in tact is a far cry from the splurge in spending seen when liquidity was at an all-time high.

Please read the offering circular at invest.autonomix.com Invest in Autonomix today. It's a realistic assessment of where the company is headed towards. Capital.com reported that many of the jobs axed were those in human resources and for its 'experiments' Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh, which did not turn out as expected. If the layoffs did not happen, Amazon might as well light some of its money paying those employees on fire. A large-scale hiring freeze is in place for most of the tech industry, and HR professionals looking over empty desks don't contribute to productivity. The mass layoffs might be one of the largest it has ever seen. But still, we were also in extraordinary and uncertain circumstances with no knowing precisely when the pandemic would reach its peak, and it did so rapidly over the first few weeks of 2022. Another argument is that for investors who can see past the immediate threats in front of them and hold Amazon for a decade or longer, it gives them a more attractive entry for scooping up Amazon shares. For better or worse, the market seems to focus on the here and now at the exclusion of everything else. So let's look at Amazon's potential upside for the future and beyond. Valuation Wall Street seems to have an overwhelming feeling of confidence about Amazon's share, despite it only having a moderate buy rating at the time of writing. 42 analysts who cover it rate it a buy, while it also has 2 hold and 2 sell ratings. One of the biggest things investors could feel confident about is its earnings per share (EPS) is expected to grow from 0.68 per share to $1.58 per share. That's an enormous growth of 132.35%, unheard of for a blue-chip stock in the FAANG acronym. Other positive aspects include that its MarketBeat consensus price target currently sits at $145.41, with analysts predicting that it has a 46.6% potential upside. Like other big names this week, investors will watch Amazon closely for guidance on the rest of the year. This may help to confirm some people's suspicions of the impending recession and its economic impact. Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon.com right now?

        "title": "In the gripping ‘My Father’s House,’ a priest takes on the Nazis",
        "content": "Listen 5 min Share Comment on this storyComment Add to your saved storiesSave Late one night in December 1943, a woman drives a Daimler quickly through the streets of Rome. In the passenger seat, a black-clad man. In the back, a man in German uniform, groaning in agony. They arrive at a hospital where a sullen orderly with a flashlight in one hand and a switchblade in the other looks at the patient, then scoffs and spits at the woman’s request to help him. The man in black steps out of the car and opens his raincoat to reveal a priest’s collar. His garb is genuine. But the patient’s Nazi uniform is a disguise: He is in fact an escaped British prisoner. “Is there a dentist in that hospital behind you?” asks the priest. “Why?” replies the orderly. “Because you’ll need one in a minute when I punch your teeth through your skull.” Joseph O’Connor’s latest novel, “My Father’s House,” begins with a potent blend of excitement, suspense and intrigue. After making his mark with his grand entrance, O’Connor’s priest goes on to steal many more scenes by showing not just the courage of his convictions but also courage under fire. The result is a gripping World War II-set drama featuring the unlikeliest of heroes, one whom the reader roots for every step of the way. WpGet the full experience.Choose your plan ArrowRight 5 historical novels that transport readers German forces have occupied Rome. Obersturmbannführer Paul Hauptmann’s iron grip on the city is a stranglehold that restricts freedom of movement and expression. He is informed that Adolf Hitler is furious that increasing numbers of Allied prisoners and Jews are escaping camps throughout Italy. Most are heading to the capital in a bid to seek sanctuary in Vatican City — the world’s smallest state and, more important, a neutral enclave and independent safe zone within Rome. Hauptmann believes that a “nuisance of a priest” is involved with an escape line and instructs his deputy to take necessary action: “Let’s get this weed uprooted.” Advertisement The Gestapo chief’s suspicions are correct. Monsignor Hugh O’Flaherty, Irish envoy to the Vatican, has assembled a ragtag group to spirit to safety those fleeing Nazi persecution. To cover their tracks, they form a choir and meet once a week for “rehearsal.” At each session, while harboring the ever-present fear of being betrayed, they go over and commit to memory the latest operational plans, escape routes, safe houses and false identities. In case the walls have ears, they speak in code — escapees collectively are “The Library,” individual fugitives “Books,” their hiding places “Shelves.” If that code is cracked, and if the group is compromised, then Nazi repercussions will be swift, brutal and far-reaching. 10 books to read in January Every so often a chorister is required to go out and perform a “solo.” When news trickles in that a Nazi invasion of the Vatican is imminent, O’Flaherty devises a mission for group member Enzo Angelucci to carry out on the night of Christmas Eve, 1943. At the 11th hour, Angelucci, who has the right attitude but insufficient expertise, panics and drops out. Rather than abort, O’Flaherty takes his place. But just as he is making progress, he turns a corner and is brought to an abrupt stop by Hauptmann and his Luger. O’Connor has written several novels based on real Irish people. His 2010 book, “Ghost Light,” chronicled the love affair between a young actress and the playwright John Millington Synge. O’Connor returned to the theatrical world for his last novel, the bravura “Shadowplay” (2019), which traced the relationship between Dracula’s creator, Bram Stoker, and two main players on the Victorian stage. Advertisement “My Father’s House” sees the Dublin-born writer once again turning fact into fiction. The novel is inspired by the true story of O’Flaherty and his associates, whose daring exploits saved lives and changed outcomes. O’Connor’s narrative charts the buildup and countdown to their mission, and O’Flaherty’s attempt to execute it. Woven around these two main threads are colorful testimonies from all eight choristers. They display a range of singular voices and absorbing backstories that flesh out each character. What to read in 2023 These include a British ambassador, a Dutch journalist and an Italian candle seller. Delia, the wife of an Irish diplomat, infuses her account with dry wit: “I was singing in Belfast the night the Luftwaffe firebombed the theatre,” she explains. “That’s what you call a mixed review.” Giovanna, a widowed countess, finds a new purpose and the will to live when she rallies to O’Flaherty’s cause. John May from London is a rough diamond and smooth operator who doesn’t suffer fools: “Once bitten, twice bite, that’s my motto.” Sign up for the Book World newsletter For a while, the book feels like an ensemble piece. However, O’Flaherty (or as May calls him, “Hughdini”) emerges as the star of the show. O’Connor brings vividly to life a man who, despite his calling, stands up to be counted after witnessing Nazi atrocities. His cat-and-mouse game with Hauptmann is expertly plotted; his desperate mission through the streets of Rome is brilliantly paced. It is hard not to be captivated by his presence throughout this hugely satisfying book, from its explosive opening to its bittersweet end.

        "title": "Amazon beats claim that warehouse quotas are biased against older workers",
        "content": "By Daniel Wiessner (Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc on Friday won its bid to dismiss a proposed class action claiming its strict production quotas for warehouse workers discriminate against older employees. U.S. Magistrate Judge Kandis Westmore in Oakland said the 2021 lawsuit, which alleges the online retailer's hourly quotas place older workers at a higher risk of injury, was too vague and failed to identify specific policies that are discriminatory. \"Simply because physical strength declines with age does not automatically mean that older workers are more likely to get injured or fail to keep up with the quotas,\" Westmore wrote. Amazon spokesperson Barbara Agrait in a statement said the claim that the company imposes quotas on workers was a misconception, and employees are able to take informal breaks during their shifts to stretch or use the bathroom. \"We do not require employees to meet specific productivity speeds or targets,\" Agrait said. \"We assess performance based on safe and achievable expectations.\" Lawyers for the plaintiff did not respond to a request for comment. The lawsuit says Amazon requires warehouse employees to move 150 to 300 items through their work posts each hour, depending on their job duties. Workers can be disciplined or fired for missing quotas or spending too much time off task. The lawsuit claimed that because workers who are 49 and older are more susceptible to injuries, including those resulting from highly repetitive motions, the quotas amount to age discrimination in violation of California law. Westmore in granting Amazon's motion to dismiss the case said it would be improper to infer that older workers are more likely to be injured merely because of their age. Amazon has been criticized by employees, lawmakers and union organizers for putting profits over worker safety by enforcing the production quotas. Last week, the U.S. workplace safety regulator said it had cited Amazon for placing workers at three warehouses at risk by exposing them to ergonomic hazards that resulted in serious injuries. Amazon, which faces up to $60,000 in fines, has said it invests hundreds of millions of dollars annually to ensure worker safety.

        "title": "Want to Invest in a Retail Stock? Ask This Question First.",
        "content": "<p>Retail is a tough business in any economic climate. A small number of retailers -- think Costco (NASDAQ: COST) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) -- manage to build up durable competitive advantages over the course of decades. Most retailers aren&#039;t so lucky. Right now, many retail stocks look surprisingly cheap based on trailing earnings. Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (NYSE: BBY) goes for around 13 times earnings, department store Macy&#039;s (NYSE: M) trades for less than 5 times earnings, and grocery chain Kroger (NYSE: KR) changes hands for roughly 14 times earnings. Those are not particularly optimistic valuation multiples. Valuation has its limits With persistently high inflation and rising interest rates pressuring consumer spending, retailers in general are likely in for a rough and unpredictable 2023. Even the strongest retailers are starting to face headwinds. Walmart (NYSE: WMT), for example, suffered a gross margin decline in the third quarter of 2022 and guided for a drop in adjusted earnings for the full fiscal year. Many retailers will see their margins contract this year as consumers pull back on spending. While Macy&#039;s stock may look extremely inexpensive, for example, it&#039;s probably not as cheap as it looks. Analysts are expecting a modest decline in earnings for the company in the upcoming fiscal year, but that could turn out to be far too optimistic. It&#039;s a similar story with Best Buy. Despite tumbling demand for PCs and smartphones, analysts still expect a small increase in Best Buy&#039;s earnings per share in the upcoming fiscal year. Color me skeptical. Deciding whether or not to invest in a retailer based on past earnings is problematic for two reasons. First, because the past is the past, and second, because the past few years have been pretty weird. An unprecedented shutdown of the economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 was followed by a period of booming demand and free-flowing stimulus. None of that was normal, so basing investment decisions on a retailer&#039;s results during that time doesn&#039;t make a ton of sense. Basing investment decisions on analyst estimates for future earnings is problematic because analysts are often wrong, and sometimes very wrong. Analyst estimates can be useful, but they certainly shouldn&#039;t form the foundation of anyone&#039;s investing process. The most important question When I consider investing in a retailer, I naturally take into account valuation, earnings, and growth. But the most important question I ask is this: If the retailer disappeared from the face of the Earth tomorrow, would consumers really care? Amazon: Yes, consumers would definitely care. There are plenty of e-commerce alternatives, but none of them have anywhere close to the product selection of Amazon. People order from Amazon because it&#039;s easy, and no other retailer has replicated that. Costco: Yes. While whether shopping at Costco actually saves you money depends on how prone you are to impulse purchases and overspending, consumers certainly believe that the company saves them money. Costco&#039;s membership renewal rates are above 90%. Best Buy: I&#039;d say yes, but not nearly as strongly compared Amazon or Costco. Best Buy has transformed itself over the past decade partly by putting a renewed focus on customer service. That&#039;s the company&#039;s big differentiator, and it&#039;s the reason why the retailer holds a somewhat unique place in the U.S. retail market. Macy&#039;s: No. There&#039;s nothing special about Macy&#039;s. There are surely some loyal customers out there, but that&#039;s true of every retailer. Macy&#039;s finds itself operating in a portion of the department store industry that has little reason to exist. It&#039;s not focused on low prices and value like Kohl&#039;s or even Target, and it doesn&#039;t have the cachet of a higher-end department store like Nordstrom. Kroger: The grocery business has become concentrated among a small number of megachains, so for that reason, consumers would probably care. But in the grocery industry, I like specialized chains like Sprouts that people shop at for reasons other than it being the closest store to their homes. None of this is to say that the best retailers on this list will definitely be great investments, or that the worst retailers on this list will definitely be duds. But if you want the odds to be in your favor, stick with retailers that have some sort of edge, and that customers genuinely like. 10 stocks we like better than Macy&#039;s When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "<p><div><p> The company’s renewable energy portfolio now totals more than 20 GW and will generate enough clean energy to power 5.3 million homes in the U.S.</p><p> Amazon’s renewable energy purchases last year brought it closer to powering its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025—five years ahead of its original target </p><p>SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced that in 2022 it grew its renewable energy capacity by 8.3 gigawatts (GW) through 133 new projects in 11 countries. This brings Amazon’s total portfolio to more than 20 GW—that could generate the amount of energy to power 5.3 million U.S. homes—across 401 renewable energy projects in 22 countries. The company’s renewable energy purchases continue to add new wind and solar projects on the grids that power Amazon’s operations, including Amazon Web Services (AWS) data centers, Amazon fulfillment centers, and physical stores around the world. </p><p> With these continued investments, Amazon set a new corporate record for the most renewable energy announced by a single company in one year. The company remains the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy—a position it’s held since 2020, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Amazon’s continued investment in renewable energy helps to accelerate growth in new regions through innovative deal structures, technologies, and cloud solutions. </p><p> These purchases also bring Amazon closer to powering its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025—five years ahead of its original 2030 target. In 2022, the company announced new projects in Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Poland, Singapore, Spain, and the U.S., and broke ground in Brazil, India, and Indonesia. With 25 new renewable energy projects secured to close out the year, the company now has 401 projects globally, including 164 wind farms and solar farms, and 237 rooftop solar projects on Amazon facilities. Once operational, Amazon’s global renewable energy projects are expected to generate 56,881 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of clean energy each year. </p><p> “As we continue to launch new renewable energy projects around the world, we’re pleased to be on track to power our operations with 100% renewable energy, five years ahead of our original target. With 133 projects in 11 countries announced in 2022, Amazon had another record year,” said Adam Selipsky, CEO of AWS. “These projects highlight the diversity of our renewable energy sources and showcase our ability to bring new technologies to new markets and further reduce the impacts of climate change.” </p><p> In addition to the 108 clean energy projects the company announced in 2022, Amazon today is announcing 25 additional 2022 clean energy projects. These include: </p><ul><li> Eleven new projects in Europe, including Finland, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, totaling 372 megawatts (MW) of capacity. Tapping into one of the world’s best renewable energy resources, Amazon continued to add to its portfolio of offshore wind projects, investing in two new offshore wind projects in Europe totaling 280 MW of capacity. </li><li> Four new projects in North America, totaling 918 MW of energy in Arizona, California, and Texas. A new solar project paired with energy storage in California allows Amazon to store clean energy produced by its solar projects and deploy it when solar energy is not available, such as in the evening hours, or during periods of high demand. Also in California, Amazon added its first on-site solar project at the Amazon Air Hub, where employees pack and handle freight and conduct planeside operations. </li><li> Ten new renewable energy projects in India, Indonesia, and Japan. In India, a third 200 MW wind-solar hybrid project was added to Amazon’s first two wind-solar hybrid projects. Renewable hybrid energy systems can play a key role in helping India accelerate the decarbonization of power generation, lowering the cost of electricity in the medium term. These hybrid energy systems also maximize clean energy use on the grid by combining two technologies with different generation profiles, reducing variability in renewable generation, and improving grid stability. In Indonesia, Amazon invested in its first renewable energy projects, securing a first-of-its-kind agreement for corporations to access additional utility-scale solar projects. In Japan, Amazon added three on-site solar projects and a new 38 MW utility-scale solar project. </li></ul><p> Rapidly scaling renewable energy is one of the most effective strategies to fight climate change. To ensure organizations’ renewable energy purchases have the greatest impact on emissions reductions, Amazon recently led the creation of the new Emissions First coalition. This coalition is leading advocacy efforts to modernize the world’s leading carbon-accounting standard, helping to reduce carbon from global electricity grids as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. </p><p> \"Amazon&#039;s clean energy portfolio doesn&#039;t just top the corporate charts—it is now among the leading utilities globally, as well,” said Kyle Harrison, head of sustainability research at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. “The fact that it announced a new annual record of clean energy in a year mired by a global energy crisis, supply chain bottlenecks and high interest rates speaks to its forward planning and expertise in navigating power markets and executing long-term contracts.\" </p><p> “Amidst the market uncertainty of 2022, Amazon led clean energy buyers and doubled down on its commitment to renewable energy,” said Miranda Ballentine, CEO of Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA). “Amazon’s commitment to decarbonization is demonstrated through its leading placement on CEBA’s Deal Tracker Top 10, within our member community, and on a global scale.” </p><p> “As Asia continues to transition away from coal and gas, these investments by Amazon in wind and solar are further evidence that there is a large and growing corporate renewable electricity demand in this region. We look forward to continuing to work with Amazon and our other ACEC members to rapidly increase the supply of renewables and to achieve our shared 100% renewable ambitions in the region,” said Sam Kimmins, director of energy at Climate Group and Asia Clean Energy Coalition (ACEC) spokesperson. </p><p> Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge in 2019, committing to reach net-zero carbon by 2040—10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. The Pledge now has nearly 400 signatories, including Best Buy, IBM, Microsoft, PepsiCo, Siemens, Unilever, Verizon, and Visa. Amazon continues to transform its transportation network, including electrifying its delivery fleet and sourcing alternatives to fossil fuels—it currently has thousands of electric delivery vehicles from Rivian in more than 100 cities and regions in the U.S., more than 3,000 electric vans delivering packages to customers in Europe, and several electric vehicle partnerships in APAC. The company is also investing $2 billion in the development of decarbonizing services and solutions through The Climate Pledge Fund.

        "content": "<p><div><p> With AWS as its preferred cloud provider, global insurance leader will use AWS capabilities and the AWS Europe (Zurich) Region to speed innovation and meet regulatory and security requirements </p><p>SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Amazon Web Services (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced that Zurich Insurance Group (Zurich), a leading multi-line insurer providing property, casualty, and life insurance solutions globally, is moving its enterprise information technology (IT) infrastructure to AWS. Zurich will use AWS’s reliable global infrastructure, advanced analytics, and machine learning technologies to deliver new digital customer experiences and drive automation at scale, in support of its worldwide digital strategy. As part of the multiyear strategic collaboration, Zurich will move 1,000 applications to AWS by 2025, including core insurance and SAP workloads. </p><p> Zurich will move its critical applications to AWS, simplifying, modernizing, and automating the company’s infrastructure. This approach will provide flexible and scalable application environments, enabling agile product development. Using Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon Aurora (AWS’s fully managed MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database built for the cloud), and AWS App Runner (AWS’s service to quickly deploy containerized web applications and APIs), Zurich will develop and bring new products to market quicker, saving approximately $30 million a year. As a result, Zurich can focus on innovation and new customer experiences, reinvesting valuable resources into new business opportunities, recruitment, and acquisition strategies. By embracing cloud technologies, Zurich will also be able to streamline and optimize its core business processes and better prepare for new reporting requirements in 2023, including alignment with international financial reporting standards—IFRS 9 and IFRS 17. </p><p> Zurich will use RISE with SAP on AWS, a fully managed offering that combines SAP’s solution and implementation experience with AWS&#039; experience in helping customers transform their SAP landscapes on the cloud. By migrating its SAP environment to AWS, Zurich will create a modern, cloud-based system connecting data across its entire business. The SAP workloads migration will consist of 20 landscapes, a collection of servers for a specific workload, including more than 100 individual systems such as human resources (HR) and finance. AWS’s extensive SAP experience will allow Zurich to increase the performance of its SAP applications and integrate its data with advanced analytics and machine learning services to gain predictive capabilities and enterprise-wide reporting. </p><p> Zurich works with AWS Skills Guild, a comprehensive skills enablement program that helps organizations accelerate cloud outcomes by creating excitement, increasing employee engagement, and nurturing a culture of learning. The insurance provider has already trained more than 400 employees, with plans to further grow the program. Zurich offers skills development opportunities to help attract and train new employee talent, and accelerate cloud adoption across the company. </p><p> “We want to help our retail customers lead safer and healthier lives, and bring our business customers peace of mind, by using the power of digital technologies to meet their evolving needs,” said Zurich’s Ericson Chan, Group Chief Information and Digital Officer. “Working with AWS will transform the way we bring solutions to market and enable us to make the most accurate and up-to-date insights available to our customers. We look forward to using the new AWS Region in Switzerland to support our regulatory reporting requirements.” </p><p> “Zurich’s focus on customers and innovation over the last 150 years is why it remains a leading insurer for more than 55 million people and businesses around the world. Moving their most critical business applications to AWS allows Zurich to put data at the heart of its business to automate processes, increase efficiency, and improve customer responsiveness,” said Matt Garman, senior vice president of Sales, Marketing, and Global Services at Amazon Web Services. “Combining Zurich’s financial expertise with AWS’s broad functionality will help the insurer continue to evolve its business to anticipate customer needs, and provide more personalized insurance products.” </p><p>About Amazon Web Services</p><p> Since 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud.

Amazon will report its 4Q-22 earnings on Thursday, February 2, 2023, and I believe the eCommerce company has a good chance of exceeding low profit expectations. I also believe that the outlook for 1Q-23 could be better than expected, and that too much negativity is currently priced into Amazon's valuation. Because the company's stock has a compelling sales valuation, it's a buy both before and after Amazon reports fourth-quarter earnings next week. Earnings Expectations Are Way Too Low If I had to bet on whether Amazon will beat profit estimates for 4Q-22, I would bet that the company will fly past earnings estimates because profit expectations are irrationally low.

Read full disclaimer. What should you look for in a powerline adapter? Speed should be your top priority. Electrical wiring is unshielded, so there can be a lot of interference slowing down the connection between adapters. Get a powerline kit with a high transmission rate if you can—you’ll probably see a quarter of that speed at the most, so the higher, the better. You should also consider adapters with pass-through electrical sockets so you don’t lose an outlet when you plug an adaptor into the wall. The sockets are filtered too, meaning your connected device won’t add more electrical noise than what you already have plaguing your home’s wiring. Best overall—TP-Link TL-PA9020P Best overall View on Amazon *Amazon.com Price (as of 1/18/23 09:06 MST). Read full disclaimer. We like that both adapters in the TL-PA9020P kit have dual Gigabit Ethernet ports, especially on the router end, since you lose a LAN port to the adapter. The kit has a great max transmission rate too, but your top speed depends on your home’s wiring and everything connected to it. Theoretically, the kit has a range of up to 984 feet, but your walls and ceilings can hide a lot of length, so the practical distance may be shorter than you think. You can pair up to 16 adapters within that range if you need to expand your connections. Pros: Dual Gigabit Ethernet ports Pass-through outlet Cons: No Wi-Fi connectivity Side-mounter LEDs Best for budgets—TP-Link TL-PA7017P Best for budgets View on Amazon *Amazon.com Price (as of 1/18/23 09:06 MST). Read full disclaimer. This powerline adapter kit is a watered-down version of the TP-Link TL-PA9020P kit listed above. It has half the transmission rate and half the Gigabit Ethernet ports for about half the cost. It should be plenty if you need a smidge more speed in areas where Wi-Fi can’t reach. Like with the TL-PA9020P kit, you can create a single TL-PA7017P powerline network with up to 16 nodes—you can even mix and match compatible TP-Link HomePlug AV2 powerline adapters. Also, the built-in pass-through socket is filtered, so no worries about adding extra electrical noise that can disrupt your powerline network. Pros: Great price Pass-through outlet Cons: Lackluster speed No Wi-Fi connectivity Best for speed—Zyxel PLA6456BB Best for speed View on Amazon *Amazon.com Price (as of 1/18/23 09:06 MST). Read full disclaimer. Zyxel’s powerline kit has the fastest transmission speeds on our list, thanks to its use of the newer Gigabit Home Networking (G.hn) standard, which theoretically enables speeds up to 2,400 Mbps. In real-world use cases, you may see 600 Mbps tops, and that’s the best you’ll probably get from networking across noisy power lines until the technology improves. Other callouts include its impressive range, easy plug-and-play setup, and included pass-through electrical socket, which prevents you from losing a power connection. The adapter’s power-saving feature claims to reduce power consumption by up to 90% by going into standby mode automatically when the adapter idles. Pros: Fast speeds Best range Cons: No Wi-Fi Lower node count Best for Wi-Fi—TP-Link TL-WPA7617 Best for Wi-Fi View on Amazon *Amazon.com Price (as of 1/18/23 09:06 MST). Read full disclaimer. We generally don’t like to suggest powerline kits with Wi-Fi because you’d probably be better off with a traditional Wi-Fi extender. But if you can’t or don’t want to use Ethernet or Wi-Fi to widen your home network, TP-Link’s TL-WPA7617 kit is here to help. At first glance, the adapter seems best for IoT devices because real-world powerline speeds are slow, and the Wi-Fi 5 standard is outdated. The big callout here is OneMesh compatibility and how the adapter chooses the best connection (Wi-Fi or powerline) to receive and send data to the router. To get the most out of this kit, you need a compatible TP-Link OneMesh router. Also, keep in mind that you’ll lose a wall plug since the Wi-Fi unit doesn’t have a pass-through socket (but the router-side unit does). Pros: AC1300 Wi-Fi access OneMesh support Cons: Single pass-thru socket High price Best nano kit—TRENDnet TPL-422E2K Best nano kit View on Amazon *Amazon.com Price (as of 1/18/23 09:06 MST). Read full disclaimer. If you don’t need pass-through sockets on your powerline adapters, TRENDnet’s TPL-422E2K starter kit should be ideal. It’s a bit more expensive than Zyxel’s kit, which packs more speed and longer range, but the compact design of each unit keeps them inconspicuous—great for offices. This kit’s theoretical speed is middling compared to other TP-Link kits. However, it supports only up to eight units in a single powerline network, where other powerline kits support up to 16. But theoretically, you could pair this kit with any other powerline adapter based on the HomePlug AV standard. Pros: Compact design Easy installation Cons: No Wi-Fi connectivity No pass-thru sockets Powerline network adapter specs and features All powerline adapters have the same mission: extend your home network using existing electrical wiring. As a result, they have nearly identical features across the board. Here are a few specifics to look for when shopping for a new kit. Speed The higher the transfer rate, the better. Electrical wiring wasn’t designed to deliver data, so there’s no shielding to reduce interference. If a powerline adapter has a theoretical transfer rate of 2,000 Mbps, you may see a quarter of that speed at most between two units. Your real-world speed depends on your electrical wiring, the power outlets, the devices you have plugged in, and the circuit breakers. Pass-through power outlet Get a powerline adapter with a pass-through socket if you’re in a space where power outlets are in high demand. These sockets let you keep the same number of working power outlets while maintaining your wired internet connections. Generally, these powerline adapters plug into the bottom socket on a wall outlet. But their size may prevent you from plugging a power connector with a ground prong (like desktop power cables) into the top socket. You should be fine with plugs without the third prong. Gigabit Ethernet All powerline adapters listed here have at least one Gigabit Ethernet port. In the typical scenario, you plug one adapter into a router and the other adapter into a wired device. You don’t want a Fast Ethernet port on an adapter, which has a max speed of 100 Mbps versus 1,000 Mbps with Gigabit Ethernet. Since you want the most out of your connection, Gigabit Ethernet is best. Shopping around for new internet? Enter your zip code below to see which providers are available in your area. Our verdict It’s hard to pick our favorite blade of grass, and that’s what it feels like while selecting the best powerline adapter. They all look identical and do the same thing. But TP-Link’s TL-PA9020P kit hits that “just right” sweet spot in our book. We like the extra Gigabit Ethernet port, especially on the router side, so you don’t lose a LAN port. The speed is decent, and the pass-through socket is a great extra. Get the TP-Link TL-PA9020P kit FAQ about powerline network adapters Who should use powerline networking? Use a powerline adapter if most of your home network works fine, but you need a more reliable, wired connection for one or two devices. For example, a powerline connection would be great for the PC in your basement that never gets a reliable Wi-Fi signal. However, powerline networking isn’t a replacement for wiring your home with Ethernet if you need a bunch of fast wired connections. Why don’t I see the advertised speeds? Your home’s electrical wiring isn’t designed to deliver data. The wires don’t have shielding to block all the electrical noise interfering with connections between adapters. Plus, your real-world speeds depend on how your home is wired (copper vs. aluminum), the electrical system’s age, wall outlet types, and installed circuit breakers. You may find that sticking with Wi-Fi 6 is a far better option than powerline. Check out our picks for the best Wi-Fi 6 routers you can get. What interferes with powerline transmissions? Anything that causes electrical noise reduces transmission speeds between powerline adapters. Here’s a list of examples: Appliances Power supplies (device chargers) Surge protectors Fluorescent lights Light dimmers How do I improve my powerline network’s performance? We put together a list of Dos and Don’ts so you can get the most out of your powerline network: Do Don’t Plug adapters directly into a wall socket Keep adapters on the same circuit Unplug nearby device chargers Keep adapters away from appliances Plug an adapter into a power strip Plug an adapter into a surge protector Plug an adapter into an extension cord Plug in an adapter near an appliance Plug an adapter into an AFCI outlet Plug an adapter into a GFCI outlet Share outlets with fluorescent lights HomePlug vs. G.hn: What’s the difference? Both are networking standards used to deliver data across a medium. The HomePlug standard primarily focuses on electrical wiring, whereas Gigabit Home Networking (G.hn) adds support for coax cable, telephone lines, and Ethernet cables. HomePlug AV2 was introduced in 2011 and is still widely used in powerline products, although the older HomePlug Alliance is now inactive. The G.hn Wave 2 standard—developed by the International Telecommunication Union—arrived in 2016 and is expected to be succeeded by Wave 3 in 2023. What does “use the same circuit” mean? Some homes may have more than one circuit breaker box. For example, there may be one feeding the main house and one feeding a garage turned into a three-room rental. Keep the powerline adapters connected to the same circuit breaker box. You may even see the best performance from adapters on the same circuit breaker.

        "content": "Amazon.com AMZN is set to give its latest quarterly earnings report on Thursday, 2023-02-02. Here's what investors need to know before the announcement. Analysts estimate that Amazon.com will report an earnings per share (EPS) of $0.19. Amazon.com bulls will hope to hear the company announce they've not only beaten that estimate, but also to provide positive guidance, or forecasted growth, for the next quarter. New investors should note that it is sometimes not an earnings beat or miss that most affects the price of a stock, but the guidance (or forecast). Historical Earnings Performance Last quarter the company beat EPS by $0.06, which was followed by a 6.8% drop in the share price the next day. Here's a look at Amazon.com's past performance and the resulting price change: Quarter Q3 2022 Q2 2022 Q1 2022 Q4 2021 EPS Estimate 0.22 0.13 0.40 0.18 EPS Actual 0.28 0.18 0.37 0.29 Price Change % -6.8% 10.36% -14.05% 13.54% Stock Performance Shares of Amazon.com were trading at $103.13 as of January 30. Over the last 52-week period, shares are down 25.82%. Given that these returns are generally negative, long-term shareholders are likely bearish going into this earnings release.

        "title": "Amazon's Ring Is Building A Mini Security Drone That Can Fly Around Your House",
        "content": "Ring revolutionized the home security industry with its namesake doorbell. The startup initially catapulted to mainstream attention after it showed up on the popular startup investing show “Shark Tank.” It originally was called Doorbot but rebranded to Ring shortly after its “Shark Tank” debut. The startup didn’t get an investment from any sharks, but it did manage to get acquired by Amazon.com Inc. AMZN for $1 billion. Since it’s been under the Amazon umbrella, Ring has released a number of new and innovative solutions. Recently, Ring released its new dashcam, which contains many of the same features as its doorbell. It’s also released several other products like smart lighting and door locks. What happened: Ring’s next-generation product, while still on-brand, is a bit less traditional. The company plans to release a mini security drone that can fly around your house. Users can program the drone to fly along custom paths to see what is happening around their house anytime from anywhere. If, for example, your front door alarm is triggered, the drone will undock and fly to the area to see what’s going on. Using the drone's built-in video camera, you can monitor anything that's happening from your phone. While the product won’t be available until at least 2024, this isn’t a vanity project or reach goal. The product is available for users by invitation. This shouldn’t be surprising because home security products are becoming incredibly advanced. MaxTracker, for example, is a startup integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into its security products. The startup creates small GPS trackers about the size of a thick credit card. The trackers have a battery life of up to a year and can use AI to distinguish between a bike being stolen versus getting knocked over or an older person falling down versus dropping their tracker. MaxTracker is raising funds to develop its products, meaning anyone can invest in the company for a limited time. Similarly, Amazon has been developing drone technology for years. It began testing Prime Air in 2013 but didn’t begin rolling out the program commercially until November. Amazon has had years of perfecting the technology, so it’s likely there will be further integrations of drone technology into the Amazon suite of products."

        "title": "The strange link between a forgotten sex cult and a president’s murder",
        "content": "Listen 5 min Share Comment on this storyComment Add to your saved storiesSave correction An earlier version of this review incorrectly stated that President James Garfield had completed six months in office on the day that he was shot. While that was true at the time of his death, he had been in office for under four months when he was shot. On July 2, 1881, President James Garfield was in a good mood. Having completed a few months in office, Gaffy, as at least one of his friends called him, was going on vacation. It was a welcome break from the presidency, which Garfield found tedious and depressing. After doing a handspring over a bed in the White House, the 49-year-old president headed to the Baltimore and Potomac railroad station. He was accompanied by Secretary of State James Blaine — and no security. While waiting for the train, he was suddenly shot twice and fell to the ground. Though he survived the initial incident, Garfield would ultimately succumb to his wounds a few months later. The killer, Charles Guiteau, was delusional and obsessive, a stalker who believed that murdering Garfield would save the Republican Party. He was also a former member of a New York utopian colony, the Oneida Community. WpGet the full experience.Choose your plan ArrowRight Like that once-famous colony, Garfield’s untimely death has been largely forgotten today, but both take on central roles in Susan Wels’s book “An Assassin in Utopia: The True Story of a Nineteenth-Century Sex Cult and a President’s Murder.” Wels has exhaustively researched the assassination and all the factors leading up to it, especially Guiteau’s association with Oneida. Packed with colorful characters and well-chosen details, this book is an engrossing — if at times too wide-ranging — account of Victorian-era American eccentricity. ‘Booth’ imagines the dysfunctional family that created John Wilkes Booth From the outside, the Oneida Community looked idyllic. Led by the preacher John Humphrey Noyes, it was the most successful utopian colony of the period, spanning more than 30 years. At its height, tourists flocked to what Wels describes as the “wild woodland” in Upstate New York, with orchards, livestock, “whizzing mills” and women with “queer cropped hair and shamelessly short skirts.” But behind the facade, Oneida’s free-love philosophies descended into pedophilia, incest and experiments in eugenics. The colony’s bizarre sexual beliefs naturally make for some of the most interesting reading in the book, as Wels knows how to paint a picture without being salacious or distasteful. Guiteau, who joined Oneida at age 19, was no doubt attracted to the colony’s erotic reputation. Unfortunately for him, the women wanted nothing to do with him and mockingly called him “Git Out.” “Sexual frustration, in fact, was the main cause of Guiteau’s misery,” Wels writes, as he “whined about his lack of access to Oneida’s women.” Still, he believed he was a great man in the making, destined to be “famous in this world.” Advertisement His narcissistic aspirations contrast sharply with Garfield’s waning ambitions. As a senator, former Civil War general and family man, Garfield seemed, by middle age, to be content with his life. No one was more shocked than he was when he emerged from the Republican convention as the presidential nominee. Instead of touring the country, he campaigned from the front porch of his Ohio farm, attracting trainloads of visitors. He seemed dismayed when he won. “He had accidentally attained the presidency,” Wels writes, “without the fire and vision for it that drove other candidates.” Share this articleShare Wels has a knack for making connections between disparate facts and coincidences. A hearse “ominously trapped” in Garfield’s inauguration parade becomes, in her hands, sad foreshadowing. Ties to Oneida surrounded the presidency. Roscoe Conkling, Garfield’s biggest political enemy, was a former district attorney in Oneida County and called “the giant of Oneida.” Garfield’s predecessor, Rutherford B. Hayes, was Noyes’s cousin. (Strangely, Hayes’s contentious election, with voter suppression, fraud accusations and simmering violence, had eerie parallels to the 2020 election.) In another coincidence, Abraham Lincoln’s son Robert was at the train station and saw Garfield’s shooting. It was the second presidential assassination he witnessed, having been at his father’s side as he died in 1865. That year, when speaking on Lincoln’s death, Garfield had said he didn’t believe it was “in the American character to become assassins.” In Jon Meacham’s biography, Lincoln is a guiding light for our times At times, Wels seems too caught up in her own research. Large portions of the book cover figures like Margaret Fuller and P.T. Barnum who are only tangentially connected to the story. “An Assassin in Utopia” also touches on a cross-dressing female Civil War spy, the spiritualist Fox sisters, the New York cholera pandemic, the history of the graham cracker, and the beliefs and ill-fated political career of newspaper publisher Horace Greeley — just to name a few threads. Throughout, Guiteau lurks in the background, growing increasingly unhinged as he drifts from one scheme to the next. Unfortunately he’s too thin and uninteresting a character to absorb all the detours, so it’s easy to lose track of why you’re reading about, say, the origins of Greeley, Colo., a place where neither Garfield nor Guiteau set foot. The upside of this approach is that by the time I got to the assassination, I was thoroughly immersed in 1880s Washington, with its shabby White House engulfed in the “stench of sewage rising out of malarial mud flats” outside. The ending is a page turner as Wels describes Garfield’s last days alive, oblivious to Guiteau skulking in the shadows. I felt real sympathy for the charismatic, reluctant president. “An Assassin in Utopia” may not stay focused on the story its title promises, but it does succeed in humanizing Garfield and the tragedy of his early death. “I am bidding goodbye to the freedom of private life, and to a long series of happy years,” Garfield wrote at the beginning of his term, unaware of how true those words would turn out to be.

Lynch&#039;s common sense approach and quick wit made him one of the most quoted investors on Wall Street. (\"Go for a business that any idiot can run -- because sooner or later, any idiot probably is going to run it,\" is one of his many pearls of wisdom.) Lynch&#039;s bestseller One Up on Wall Street is something of a \"stocks for the everyman/everywoman\", breaking his approach down into easy-to-understand concepts.

If so, congratulations: You recently became incrementally richer. As is their habit, both companies recently declared dividend raises. Still, while this means a bit more coin in the bank accounts of their investors, it doesn&#039;t necessarily mean either company is investment-worthy today. So let&#039;s put Apple and ASML under the microscope and see if they pass inspection. 1. Apple It&#039;s a little hard to imagine these days, but for the first few decades of its existence, Apple was basically a pure-play tech hardware company. It had a regularly refreshed lineup of personal computers that usually won praise for their quality and utility although the company never became a No. 1 producer of mass-market machines. These days, of course, Apple is an electronics and consumer-goods powerhouse that has sprouted thick branches from that trunk of original computer tech. We see iPhones everywhere, and it&#039;s not unusual for a household to have more than a single iPad tablet. Ever bold, the tech giant has pushed confidently into other product categories such as smartwatches and even computer chips. Apple has cleverly positioned itself as a broadening electronics retailer whose products all operate on the same software platform. With this, its mighty App Store draws billions of dollars in revenue from the software you and I have on our iDevices, be it purchase charges, in-store buys, or subscriptions. The iOS operating system will continue to be foundational, and those apps and commerce opportunities will keep coming. The King of Cupertino has been on its throne for a long time now, but it still seems like it has plenty of growth in store. Across all of its fiscal 2022, Apple managed to increase its net sales by 8%, with net income improving by 5%. Macroeconomic strains and supply issues have dinged 2023 results so far, but that should reverse in the next year. On average, analysts are modeling 6% growth on the top line for 2024 and, much better, almost 10% improvement in per-share net income. So is it any wonder that Apple just pulled the trigger on yet another dividend raise? The new quarterly disbursement is $0.24 per share, 4% higher than its previous payout. This was paid on May 18. While the enhanced amount doesn&#039;t make it the highest yielder on the scene (at under 0.6%), it represents the 11th straight raise for the company, which seems fully determined to keep rewarding its shareholders. 2. ASML In contrast to the overly familiar Apple, ASML is quite the under-the-radar stock. Based in the Netherlands, the company produces the photolithography machines used to make computer chips. In fact, it&#039;s the sole maker of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) devices, the only machines that can produce certain types of advanced chips. As you might imagine, this is a monster business in a world stuffed full of smart devices, servers, and computers. Enduringly strong demand for chips keeps pushing ASML&#039;s financials ever higher. In its first quarter, the company reaped $7.3 billion in revenue, a very high leap over the $3.8 billion a mere one year prior. Not to be outdone, net income came in nearly three times higher, at $2.1 billion, against $750 million from a year ago. As a result, ASML is a highly profitable company that throws off a lot of cash. It likes to direct some of this to its shareholders, and recently it rewarded them with -- you guessed it -- a dividend raise. The company&#039;s quarterly payout now stands at 1.69 euros ($1.82) per share, a robust 23% higher than the 1.37 euros ($1.49) it was distributing previously. ASML&#039;s dividend raise kicked in with the quarterly payout dispensed on May 10. At the most recent closing share price, the new amount yields just over 1%. None of this is a fluke or a one-off. ASML is facing the \"good problem\" of being too popular -- to the point where at the end of the first quarter, its order backlog was an intimidating $42 billion. That&#039;s nearly double the revenue it earned in all of 2022. How&#039;s that for popularity? Particularly with an explosion in the appeal and prominence of artificial intelligence (AI), consumers&#039; devices will need ever more computing power. ASML is guiding for 25% growth on the top line for 2023 compared to the previous year. Profitability should continue to be strong, ringing in at a gross margin of around 50%. We can easily imagine more double-digit growth in future years. With that kind of potential, ASML looks like a great stock to own, and now looks like a good time to own it. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Through 10:05 a.m. ET, shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are up a respectable 2.2%, while semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) is gaining 4.6%, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is leading the pack higher with a 10.1% gain. The precise reasons why these stocks are rising may differ -- but artificial intelligence (AI) lies at the root of each rally. So what Let&#039;s begin with Microsoft. As The Fly reports this morning, Microsoft just announced huge month-over-month growth in customers signing up to use its Azure cloud computing service for OpenAI artificial intelligence functions -- from 2,500 customers disclosed on April 25 to 4,500 customers announced at the Microsoft Build 2023 developer conference yesterday, an 80% increase. That makes OpenAI \"the fastest growing service in Azure history,\" and promises to help drive growth at Microsoft going forward. Thus, while most analysts polled by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence have Microsoft pegged for relatively modest 11.5% earnings growth over the next five years, at least one analyst (Oppenheimer) now predicts sales growth alone will reach the mid-teens by 2025 -- and with the high profit margins at Azure (43.5%), earnings growth could be faster than that. Continuing the AI-equals-growth theme, you may have heard that Nvidia just reported earnings and, while sales did decline 13% in Q1, this was less of a drop than analysts expected. What&#039;s more, Nvidia guided investors to expect an immediate turnaround in its business in the second quarter -- sales up 64%, driven by surging demand for chips to support AI functions. Now what So great news for Nvidia -- and as you might expect, Nvidia stock is leaping 25% higher today -- but what does it mean for ASML and Taiwan Semiconductor? Why are those two stocks rising today as well? Well, the thing is -- as CNBC points out this morning -- Nvidia is selling a lot of AI chips, but Nvidia doesn&#039;t actually make its own chips. Rather, it farms out the manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor, which in turn relies upon machines built by ASML to make those chips. Hence, what&#039;s good news for Nvidia is logically good news for TSMC and ASML, as well. That&#039;s actually pretty great news for investors because, as of this morning, Nvidia stock is selling for a pricey 219 times earnings, versus a more modest (but still pricey 80 times earnings for TSMC, and an (only relatively) cheap 37 times earnings for ASML. Personally, when I look at nosebleed valuations like these, I can&#039;t help wondering if investors are getting a bit irrationally exuberant about the whole AI phenomenon, and the stocks tied to it. But then again, there&#039;s that 64% growth at Nvidia to consider. Maybe, just maybe, what we&#039;re actually seeing here is just plain, entirely rational exuberance. 10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "<p>By Sruthi Shankar May 25 (Reuters) - European stocks steadied on Thursday after their worst two-day selloff since March, as investors balanced concerns over the U.S. debt ceiling standoff and a global economic slowdown with optimism from upbeat corporate earnings. The pan-European STOXX 600 index .STOXX added 0.1% after shedding about 2.5% in the past two days, triggered by a selloff in luxury stocks and lack of progress in talks to raise the U.S. debt ceiling and avert a default. Ratings agency Fitch put the United States&#039; credit on watch for a possible downgrade on Wednesday. European chipmakers gained on Thursday after the world&#039;s most valuable chipmaker Nvidia Corp NVDA.Oforecast quarterly revenue more than 50% above Wall Street estimates, and said it is boosting supply to meet surging demand for its artificial-intelligence chips Shares of BE Semiconductor BESI.AS jumped 7.8%, while ASM International ASMI.AS rose 7.9% and ASML Holdings ASML.AS added 5.4%. Bank of America analysts see both ASM and ASML as beneficiaries of growing AI adoption. Germany&#039;s DAX .DAX was down 0.2% after data showed Europe&#039;s biggest economy economy contracted in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the previous three months, thereby signalling a recession. European stocks came under selling pressure this week as investors fretted over a potential U.S. debt default and sticky inflation in the UK after a strong earnings season had boosted several regional bourses to record highs. Cineworld CINE.L fell 3.6% even as the British cinema chain operator said it expects to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July.

Lynch&#039;s common sense approach and quick wit made him one of the most quoted investors on Wall Street. (\"Go for a business that any idiot can run -- because sooner or later, any idiot probably is going to run it,\" is one of his many pearls of wisdom.) Lynch&#039;s bestseller One Up on Wall Street is something of a \"stocks for the everyman/everywoman\", breaking his approach down into easy-to-understand concepts.

        "title": "2 Dividend Stocks Putting More Money in Investors' Pockets",
        "content": "<p>Are you a shareholder of either Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) or ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML)? If so, congratulations: You recently became incrementally richer. As is their habit, both companies recently declared dividend raises. Still, while this means a bit more coin in the bank accounts of their investors, it doesn&#039;t necessarily mean either company is investment-worthy today. So let&#039;s put Apple and ASML under the microscope and see if they pass inspection. 1. Apple It&#039;s a little hard to imagine these days, but for the first few decades of its existence, Apple was basically a pure-play tech hardware company. It had a regularly refreshed lineup of personal computers that usually won praise for their quality and utility although the company never became a No. 1 producer of mass-market machines. These days, of course, Apple is an electronics and consumer-goods powerhouse that has sprouted thick branches from that trunk of original computer tech. We see iPhones everywhere, and it&#039;s not unusual for a household to have more than a single iPad tablet. Ever bold, the tech giant has pushed confidently into other product categories such as smartwatches and even computer chips. Apple has cleverly positioned itself as a broadening electronics retailer whose products all operate on the same software platform. With this, its mighty App Store draws billions of dollars in revenue from the software you and I have on our iDevices, be it purchase charges, in-store buys, or subscriptions. The iOS operating system will continue to be foundational, and those apps and commerce opportunities will keep coming. The King of Cupertino has been on its throne for a long time now, but it still seems like it has plenty of growth in store. Across all of its fiscal 2022, Apple managed to increase its net sales by 8%, with net income improving by 5%. Macroeconomic strains and supply issues have dinged 2023 results so far, but that should reverse in the next year. On average, analysts are modeling 6% growth on the top line for 2024 and, much better, almost 10% improvement in per-share net income. So is it any wonder that Apple just pulled the trigger on yet another dividend raise? The new quarterly disbursement is $0.24 per share, 4% higher than its previous payout. This was paid on May 18. While the enhanced amount doesn&#039;t make it the highest yielder on the scene (at under 0.6%), it represents the 11th straight raise for the company, which seems fully determined to keep rewarding its shareholders. 2. ASML In contrast to the overly familiar Apple, ASML is quite the under-the-radar stock. Based in the Netherlands, the company produces the photolithography machines used to make computer chips. In fact, it&#039;s the sole maker of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) devices, the only machines that can produce certain types of advanced chips. As you might imagine, this is a monster business in a world stuffed full of smart devices, servers, and computers. Enduringly strong demand for chips keeps pushing ASML&#039;s financials ever higher. In its first quarter, the company reaped $7.3 billion in revenue, a very high leap over the $3.8 billion a mere one year prior. Not to be outdone, net income came in nearly three times higher, at $2.1 billion, against $750 million from a year ago. As a result, ASML is a highly profitable company that throws off a lot of cash. It likes to direct some of this to its shareholders, and recently it rewarded them with -- you guessed it -- a dividend raise. The company&#039;s quarterly payout now stands at 1.69 euros ($1.82) per share, a robust 23% higher than the 1.37 euros ($1.49) it was distributing previously. ASML&#039;s dividend raise kicked in with the quarterly payout dispensed on May 10. At the most recent closing share price, the new amount yields just over 1%. None of this is a fluke or a one-off. ASML is facing the \"good problem\" of being too popular -- to the point where at the end of the first quarter, its order backlog was an intimidating $42 billion. That&#039;s nearly double the revenue it earned in all of 2022. How&#039;s that for popularity? Particularly with an explosion in the appeal and prominence of artificial intelligence (AI), consumers&#039; devices will need ever more computing power. ASML is guiding for 25% growth on the top line for 2023 compared to the previous year. Profitability should continue to be strong, ringing in at a gross margin of around 50%. We can easily imagine more double-digit growth in future years. With that kind of potential, ASML looks like a great stock to own, and now looks like a good time to own it. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Why Microsoft, ASML, and TSMC Stocks All Just Popped",
        "content": "<p>What happened AI news drove big tech stock gains in early trading Thursday. Through 10:05 a.m. ET, shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are up a respectable 2.2%, while semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) is gaining 4.6%, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is leading the pack higher with a 10.1% gain. The precise reasons why these stocks are rising may differ -- but artificial intelligence (AI) lies at the root of each rally. So what Let&#039;s begin with Microsoft. As The Fly reports this morning, Microsoft just announced huge month-over-month growth in customers signing up to use its Azure cloud computing service for OpenAI artificial intelligence functions -- from 2,500 customers disclosed on April 25 to 4,500 customers announced at the Microsoft Build 2023 developer conference yesterday, an 80% increase. That makes OpenAI \"the fastest growing service in Azure history,\" and promises to help drive growth at Microsoft going forward. Thus, while most analysts polled by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence have Microsoft pegged for relatively modest 11.5% earnings growth over the next five years, at least one analyst (Oppenheimer) now predicts sales growth alone will reach the mid-teens by 2025 -- and with the high profit margins at Azure (43.5%), earnings growth could be faster than that. Continuing the AI-equals-growth theme, you may have heard that Nvidia just reported earnings and, while sales did decline 13% in Q1, this was less of a drop than analysts expected. What&#039;s more, Nvidia guided investors to expect an immediate turnaround in its business in the second quarter -- sales up 64%, driven by surging demand for chips to support AI functions. Now what So great news for Nvidia -- and as you might expect, Nvidia stock is leaping 25% higher today -- but what does it mean for ASML and Taiwan Semiconductor? Why are those two stocks rising today as well? Well, the thing is -- as CNBC points out this morning -- Nvidia is selling a lot of AI chips, but Nvidia doesn&#039;t actually make its own chips. Rather, it farms out the manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor, which in turn relies upon machines built by ASML to make those chips. Hence, what&#039;s good news for Nvidia is logically good news for TSMC and ASML, as well. That&#039;s actually pretty great news for investors because, as of this morning, Nvidia stock is selling for a pricey 219 times earnings, versus a more modest (but still pricey 80 times earnings for TSMC, and an (only relatively) cheap 37 times earnings for ASML. Personally, when I look at nosebleed valuations like these, I can&#039;t help wondering if investors are getting a bit irrationally exuberant about the whole AI phenomenon, and the stocks tied to it. But then again, there&#039;s that 64% growth at Nvidia to consider. Maybe, just maybe, what we&#039;re actually seeing here is just plain, entirely rational exuberance. 10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Q2 net bookings were €4.50 billion versus €8.46 billion a year ago. The gross margin increased by 220 bps Y/Y to 51.3%. GAAP EPS was €4.93 ($5.37) above the consensus of $5.17. ASML held €6.34 billion in cash and equivalents. Buybacks & Dividends: An interim dividend of €1.45 per ordinary share will be payable on August 10. In Q2, ASML purchased around €500 million worth of shares under the 2022-2025 share buyback program. \"Due to strong DUV revenue and despite the increased uncertainties, ASML expects strong growth for 2023 with a net sales increase towards 30% and a slight improvement in gross margin, relative to 2022,\" said ASML CEO Peter Wennink. Outlook: ASML expects Q3 net sales of €6.5 billion - €7.0 billion vs. consensus $7.41 billion and a ~50% gross margin.

The company that provides hardware, software, and services to chipmakers for the mass production of integrated circuits (microchips) also raised its 2023 revenue outlook as demand continues to outpace expectations following better-than-expected Q2 results. Q2 Earnings in Detail ASML reported net sales of €6.90 billion, which exceeded analysts’ estimate of €6.71 billion, reflecting additional DUV (Deep Ultraviolet, a lithography system used in the manufacturing of microchips) immersion revenue in the quarter. The company’s top line also showed sequential and year-over-year improvement despite continued macroeconomic uncertainties. The company said that sales of the new lithography systems increased to 107 units in Q2 from 96 units in Q1. Moreover, it was significantly higher than the 83 units sold in the prior-year quarter. While macro uncertainty is hurting end-market demand, overall demand still exceeds its capacity. Further, ASML’s solid backlog of about €38 billion and increase in net bookings suggest that the company is well-positioned to navigate the near-term challenges well and deliver strong growth in the long term. Also, solid demand for AI (Artificial Intelligence) microchips and a reacceleration in semiconductor production bode well for future growth. Thanks to higher revenues and increased margins, ASML delivered earnings of €4.93 a share, surpassing analysts’ estimate of €4.63 and growing over 39% year-over-year. Revenue Outlook Raised Thanks to the momentum in its business and strong DUV revenue, ASML raised its full-year revenue outlook. The company now expects 2023 revenues to increase by 30% compared to its earlier growth projection of 25%. As for the third quarter, ASML expects its top line to be in the range of €6.5 billion to €7.0 billion, compared to €5.78 billion in the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, gross margin is projected to come in at 50%, reflecting a decline compared to Q3 of the previous year. Is ASML Holding a Good Stock to Buy? Analysts are bullish about ASML’s prospects. Goldman Sachs analyst Alexander Duval reiterated a Buy on ASML (the stock is also on Goldman’s Conviction List) on July 14. The analyst sees AI as a strong demand driver for ASML in the long term. His price target of €825 implies more than 24% upside potential from current levels. Including Duval, ASML stock has received 11 Buy and two Hold recommendations for a Strong Buy consensus rating. Analysts’ average price target of €752.77 indicates 13.2% upside potential.

ASML continues to see resilient demand for its products, especially in DUV, which was able to offset some weakness in EUV demand. The order intake came in better than anticipated. Sundry Photography Investment thesis I maintain my Buy rating on ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) and update my revenue and EPS estimates following the company's Q2 2023 results, which beat its previous guidance and that of Wall Street analysts. Despite facing its fair share of headwinds, ASML continues to show operational excellence and remarkable resiliency. Despite a 21% increase in share price over the last three months, I believe ASML shares still offer decent upside. As my investment thesis remains unchanged, this is what I wrote three months ago: ASML is an incredibly important company in the global semiconductor industry, if not the most important one. Through its highly advanced EUV technology, the company enables semiconductor manufacturers to build the world's most advanced chips.

However, the increased guidance is largely due to changes in revenue recognition from fast shipment agreements. Michael Vi ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) reported its Q2 earnings today (July 19, 2023). The company came in toward the high end of its previous guidance from Q1. Additionally, ASML raised its guidance for full-year revenue growth from 25% to 30%. However, although the increased guidance may initially seem like a signal of material improvements in ASML's prospects, a closer examination reveals that not much has fundamentally changed. Much of the increase in guidance can be explained by changes in revenue recognition as ASML rolls out fast shipment for its DUV immersion products. Once these changes are accounted, investors should have a more muted response to ASML's latest update. The Full-Year Guidance In 2022, ASML's revenues stood at €21.2 billion. In the earnings press release, ASML's CEO Peter Wennink stated: Due to strong DUV revenue and despite the increased uncertainties, ASML expects\n\n---\n\n[2023-07-20] 2023-07-20 04:44:34\n标题: ASML Holding N.V.'s (AMS:ASML) Stock's On An Uptrend: Are Strong Financials Guiding The Market?\n内容: Most readers would already be aware that ASML Holding's (AMS:ASML) stock increased significantly by 14% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on ASML Holding's ROE. Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for ASML Holding How To Calculate Return On Equity? ROE can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for ASML Holding is: 70% = €7.4b ÷ €11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023). The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every €1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated €0.70 in profit. What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth? We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics. ASML Holding's Earnings Growth And 70% ROE Firstly, we acknowledge that ASML Holding has a significantly high ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 18% which is quite remarkable. Under the circumstances, ASML Holding's considerable five year net income growth of 25% was to be expected. As a next step, we compared ASML Holding's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 19%. ENXTAM:ASML Past Earnings Growth July 20th 2023 Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is ASML Holding fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide. Is ASML Holding Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively? The three-year median payout ratio for ASML Holding is 32%, which is moderately low. The company is retaining the remaining 68%. By the looks of it, the dividend is well covered and ASML Holding is reinvesting its profits efficiently as evidenced by its exceptional growth which we discussed above. Besides, ASML Holding has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 32% of its profits over the next three years. As a result, ASML Holding's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 68% for future ROE. Conclusion Overall, we are quite pleased with ASML Holding's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

We believe macro headwinds and a softer EUV growth outlook will weigh on the stock, and we don't see many catalysts in the H1 2024 semi-cap spend. kynny We're downgrading ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) to a hold after Q2 2023 earnings results; while we continue to expect ASML to outperform in the medium to long term as lithography spending re-accelerates into 2H24, we see short-term uncertainties due to EUV (extreme ultraviolet) weakness. In the near term, we expect macro headwinds and softer EUV growth to weigh down the stock. Management guided lower for EUV growth this year; EUV growth is now projected to be 25% from the previous estimated 40%. We're seeing end-market demand bottoming out in 2H23, consistent with management's expectations on the Q2 earnings call. We also extend our bearish sentiment of ASML to its semi-cap peers Lam Research Corporation (LRCX) and Applied Materials (AMAT). We're downgrading LRCX and AMAT to hold-ratings; both companies operate in the etching and deposition segments of the semi-cap",

Dutch export control rules will forbid ASML from maintaining, repairing and providing spare parts for controlled equipment without government approval, people familiar with the matter said. Those restrictions are related to new regulations the government published in June that prohibit ASML from shipping some so-called immersion deep ultraviolet lithography machines, its second-most capable machinery, to China without a license beginning in September."

        "content": "ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML)(DE:ASME) delivered Q2 financials that came ahead of analysts’ estimates. The company that provides hardware, software, and services to chipmakers for the mass production of integrated circuits (microchips) also raised its 2023 revenue outlook as demand continues to outpace expectations following better-than-expected Q2 results. Q2 Earnings in Detail ASML reported net sales of €6.90 billion, which exceeded analysts’ estimate of €6.71 billion, reflecting additional DUV (Deep Ultraviolet, a lithography system used in the manufacturing of microchips) immersion revenue in the quarter. The company’s top line also showed sequential and year-over-year improvement despite continued macroeconomic uncertainties. The company said that sales of the new lithography systems increased to 107 units in Q2 from 96 units in Q1. Moreover, it was significantly higher than the 83 units sold in the prior-year quarter. While macro uncertainty is hurting end-market demand, overall demand still exceeds its capacity. Further, ASML’s solid backlog of about €38 billion and increase in net bookings suggest that the company is well-positioned to navigate the near-term challenges well and deliver strong growth in the long term. Also, solid demand for AI (Artificial Intelligence) microchips and a reacceleration in semiconductor production bode well for future growth. Thanks to higher revenues and increased margins, ASML delivered earnings of €4.93 a share, surpassing analysts’ estimate of €4.63 and growing over 39% year-over-year. Revenue Outlook Raised Thanks to the momentum in its business and strong DUV revenue, ASML raised its full-year revenue outlook. The company now expects 2023 revenues to increase by 30% compared to its earlier growth projection of 25%. As for the third quarter, ASML expects its top line to be in the range of €6.5 billion to €7.0 billion, compared to €5.78 billion in the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, gross margin is projected to come in at 50%, reflecting a decline compared to Q3 of the previous year. Is ASML Holding a Good Stock to Buy? Analysts are bullish about ASML’s prospects. Goldman Sachs analyst Alexander Duval reiterated a Buy on ASML (the stock is also on Goldman’s Conviction List) on July 14. The analyst sees AI as a strong demand driver for ASML in the long term. His price target of €825 implies more than 24% upside potential from current levels. Including Duval, ASML stock has received 11 Buy and two Hold recommendations for a Strong Buy consensus rating. Analysts’ average price target of €752.77 indicates 13.2% upside potential. Disclosure"

In this article, we decided to focus on ASML Holding's ROE. Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for ASML Holding How To Calculate Return On Equity? ROE can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for ASML Holding is: 70% = €7.4b ÷ €11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023). The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every €1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated €0.70 in profit. What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth? We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics. ASML Holding's Earnings Growth And 70% ROE Firstly, we acknowledge that ASML Holding has a significantly high ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 18% which is quite remarkable. Under the circumstances, ASML Holding's considerable five year net income growth of 25% was to be expected. As a next step, we compared ASML Holding's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 19%. ENXTAM:ASML Past Earnings Growth July 20th 2023 Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is ASML Holding fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide. Is ASML Holding Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively? The three-year median payout ratio for ASML Holding is 32%, which is moderately low. The company is retaining the remaining 68%. By the looks of it, the dividend is well covered and ASML Holding is reinvesting its profits efficiently as evidenced by its exceptional growth which we discussed above. Besides, ASML Holding has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 32% of its profits over the next three years. As a result, ASML Holding's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 68% for future ROE. Conclusion Overall, we are quite pleased with ASML Holding's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

The Q2 net bookings were €4.50 billion versus €8.46 billion a year ago. The gross margin increased by 220 bps Y/Y to 51.3%. GAAP EPS was €4.93 ($5.37) above the consensus of $5.17. ASML held €6.34 billion in cash and equivalents. Buybacks & Dividends: An interim dividend of €1.45 per ordinary share will be payable on August 10. In Q2, ASML purchased around €500 million worth of shares under the 2022-2025 share buyback program. \"Due to strong DUV revenue and despite the increased uncertainties, ASML expects strong growth for 2023 with a net sales increase towards 30% and a slight improvement in gross margin, relative to 2022,\" said ASML CEO Peter Wennink. Outlook: ASML expects Q3 net sales of €6.5 billion - €7.0 billion vs. consensus $7.41 billion and a ~50% gross margin.

The company that provides hardware, software, and services to chipmakers for the mass production of integrated circuits (microchips) also raised its 2023 revenue outlook as demand continues to outpace expectations following better-than-expected Q2 results. Q2 Earnings in Detail ASML reported net sales of €6.90 billion, which exceeded analysts’ estimate of €6.71 billion, reflecting additional DUV (Deep Ultraviolet, a lithography system used in the manufacturing of microchips) immersion revenue in the quarter. The company’s top line also showed sequential and year-over-year improvement despite continued macroeconomic uncertainties. The company said that sales of the new lithography systems increased to 107 units in Q2 from 96 units in Q1. Moreover, it was significantly higher than the 83 units sold in the prior-year quarter. While macro uncertainty is hurting end-market demand, overall demand still exceeds its capacity. Further, ASML’s solid backlog of about €38 billion and increase in net bookings suggest that the company is well-positioned to navigate the near-term challenges well and deliver strong growth in the long term. Also, solid demand for AI (Artificial Intelligence) microchips and a reacceleration in semiconductor production bode well for future growth. Thanks to higher revenues and increased margins, ASML delivered earnings of €4.93 a share, surpassing analysts’ estimate of €4.63 and growing over 39% year-over-year. Revenue Outlook Raised Thanks to the momentum in its business and strong DUV revenue, ASML raised its full-year revenue outlook. The company now expects 2023 revenues to increase by 30% compared to its earlier growth projection of 25%. As for the third quarter, ASML expects its top line to be in the range of €6.5 billion to €7.0 billion, compared to €5.78 billion in the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, gross margin is projected to come in at 50%, reflecting a decline compared to Q3 of the previous year. Is ASML Holding a Good Stock to Buy? Analysts are bullish about ASML’s prospects. Goldman Sachs analyst Alexander Duval reiterated a Buy on ASML (the stock is also on Goldman’s Conviction List) on July 14. The analyst sees AI as a strong demand driver for ASML in the long term. His price target of €825 implies more than 24% upside potential from current levels. Including Duval, ASML stock has received 11 Buy and two Hold recommendations for a Strong Buy consensus rating. Analysts’ average price target of €752.77 indicates 13.2% upside potential.

Sundry Photography Investment thesis I maintain my Buy rating on ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) and update my revenue and EPS estimates following the company's Q2 2023 results, which beat its previous guidance and that of Wall Street analysts. Despite facing its fair share of headwinds, ASML continues to show operational excellence and remarkable resiliency. Despite a 21% increase in share price over the last three months, I believe ASML shares still offer decent upside. As my investment thesis remains unchanged, this is what I wrote three months ago: ASML is an incredibly important company in the global semiconductor industry, if not the most important one.

However, the increased guidance is largely due to changes in revenue recognition from fast shipment agreements. Michael Vi ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) reported its Q2 earnings today (July 19, 2023). The company came in toward the high end of its previous guidance from Q1. Additionally, ASML raised its guidance for full-year revenue growth from 25% to 30%. However, although the increased guidance may initially seem like a signal of material improvements in ASML's prospects, a closer examination reveals that not much has fundamentally changed. Much of the increase in guidance can be explained by changes in revenue recognition as ASML rolls out fast shipment for its DUV immersion products. Once these changes are accounted, investors should have a more muted response to ASML's latest update. The Full-Year Guidance In 2022, ASML's revenues stood at €21.2 billion. In the earnings press release, ASML's CEO Peter Wennink stated: Due to strong DUV revenue and despite the increased uncertainties, ASML expects",

        "content": "ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML)(DE:ASME) delivered Q2 financials that came ahead of analysts’ estimates. The company that provides hardware, software, and services to chipmakers for the mass production of integrated circuits (microchips) also raised its 2023 revenue outlook as demand continues to outpace expectations following better-than-expected Q2 results. Q2 Earnings in Detail ASML reported net sales of €6.90 billion, which exceeded analysts’ estimate of €6.71 billion, reflecting additional DUV (Deep Ultraviolet, a lithography system used in the manufacturing of microchips) immersion revenue in the quarter. The company’s top line also showed sequential and year-over-year improvement despite continued macroeconomic uncertainties. The company said that sales of the new lithography systems increased to 107 units in Q2 from 96 units in Q1. Moreover, it was significantly higher than the 83 units sold in the prior-year quarter. While macro uncertainty is hurting end-market demand, overall demand still exceeds its capacity. Further, ASML’s solid backlog of about €38 billion and increase in net bookings suggest that the company is well-positioned to navigate the near-term challenges well and deliver strong growth in the long term. Also, solid demand for AI (Artificial Intelligence) microchips and a reacceleration in semiconductor production bode well for future growth. Thanks to higher revenues and increased margins, ASML delivered earnings of €4.93 a share, surpassing analysts’ estimate of €4.63 and growing over 39% year-over-year. Revenue Outlook Raised Thanks to the momentum in its business and strong DUV revenue, ASML raised its full-year revenue outlook. The company now expects 2023 revenues to increase by 30% compared to its earlier growth projection of 25%. As for the third quarter, ASML expects its top line to be in the range of €6.5 billion to €7.0 billion, compared to €5.78 billion in the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, gross margin is projected to come in at 50%, reflecting a decline compared to Q3 of the previous year. Is ASML Holding a Good Stock to Buy? Analysts are bullish about ASML’s prospects. Goldman Sachs analyst Alexander Duval reiterated a Buy on ASML (the stock is also on Goldman’s Conviction List) on July 14. The analyst sees AI as a strong demand driver for ASML in the long term. His price target of €825 implies more than 24% upside potential from current levels. Including Duval, ASML stock has received 11 Buy and two Hold recommendations for a Strong Buy consensus rating. Analysts’ average price target of €752.77 indicates 13.2% upside potential. Disclosure"

Sundry Photography Investment thesis I maintain my Buy rating on ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) and update my revenue and EPS estimates following the company's Q2 2023 results, which beat its previous guidance and that of Wall Street analysts. Despite facing its fair share of headwinds, ASML continues to show operational excellence and remarkable resiliency. Despite a 21% increase in share price over the last three months, I believe ASML shares still offer decent upside. As my investment thesis remains unchanged, this is what I wrote three months ago: ASML is an incredibly important company in the global semiconductor industry, if not the most important one. Through its highly advanced EUV technology, the company enables semiconductor manufacturers to build the world's most advanced chips. And with the company holding a monopoly in this industry, it is incredibly well-positioned to benefit from the increase in demand ASML Q2 revenue by region (ASML) ASML's historical capital return (ASML) ASML long term outlook (ASML) Long-term estimates (Author)"

The company came in toward the high end of its previous guidance from Q1. Additionally, ASML raised its guidance for full-year revenue growth from 25% to 30%. However, although the increased guidance may initially seem like a signal of material improvements in ASML's prospects, a closer examination reveals that not much has fundamentally changed. Much of the increase in guidance can be explained by changes in revenue recognition as ASML rolls out fast shipment for its DUV immersion products. Once these changes are accounted, investors should have a more muted response to ASML's latest update. The Full-Year Guidance In 2022, ASML's revenues stood at €21.2 billion.

The US revealed its own Chip and Science Act last year, which pledged $52.7bn for semiconductor research, development, manufacturing and workforce development. The EU has also been working on its own Chips Act – a €43bn strategy to become a leader in the semiconductor sector. The Act was provisionally agreed by the European Council and Parliament last month and aims to double the EU’s global market share in semiconductors to 20pc by 2030 while protecting Europe’s supply chain. Meanwhile, the UK revealed its strategy to build up and protect its semiconductor sector earlier this week, with plans to invest £1bn over the next decade. The UK government said this National Semiconductor Strategy is a 20-year plan to build upon the country’s strengths in design, R&D and compound semiconductors. 10 things you need to know direct to your inbox every weekday.

Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 3.42%, the lowest has been 2.43%, and the highest has been 6.93%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.66 (n=236). The current dividend yield is 1.36 standard deviations below the historical average. Additionally, the company&#039;s dividend payout ratio is 0.60. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company&#039;s income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company&#039;s income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5. The company&#039;s 3-Year dividend growth rate is 0.42%, demonstrating that it has increased its dividend over time. Broadcom Background Information (This description is provided by the company.)

Shares of Nvidia Corp , the world&#039;s most valuable listed chip company, jumped 25.5% to hit a record high, after it forecast quarterly revenue 50% higher than Wall Street estimates and said it was ramping up supply to meet demand for its artificial-intelligence chips. Heavyweight AI players such as Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc rose about 2.2% and 1.7%, respectively, while the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index advanced 4.6% to its highest level in more than a year. \"The word of the month is AI,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York. \"Investors are just looking for any area of growth and right now that happens to be semiconductors.\" Other chip companies including Advanced Micro Devices Inc , Micron Technology Inc and Broadcom Inc rose between 2.6% and 9.5%. Dow Jones Industrial Average component Intel Corp , which has little AI exposure, fell 5.7%. Wall Street&#039;s main indexes have dropped sharply in the last two sessions and could log their worst week in more than two months as investors await clarity on whether lawmakers will strike a deal to raise the nation&#039;s $31.4 trillion debt ceiling or risk a calamitous default. Later in the day, the White House and congressional Republicans will resume negotiations to try to reach a deal as the June 1 deadline looms large. U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said to Fox News that he was unsure if the two sides will be able to reach a deal on Thursday. Reflecting the market uncertainty, yields on U.S. Treasury bills maturing in early June rose above 7%, while two-year yields hit their highest since March after ratings agencies Fitch and DBRS Morningstar put the United States on credit watch for a possible downgrade. [US/] Meanwhile, data showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose only moderately last week, while a Commerce Department report confirmed economic growth slowed in the first quarter.

Among more mid-cap retail earnings, Best Buy Co Inc rose 3.7% after the electronics retailer beat quarterly profit estimates, while discount retailer Dollar Tree Inc fell 15.0% on cutting its annual profit outlook. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.46-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.47-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

Broadcom Declares $4.60 Dividend On March 2, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $4.60 per share ($18.40 annualized). Shareholders of record as of March 22, 2023 received the payment on March 31, 2023. Previously, the company paid $4.60 per share. At the current share price of $728.80 / share, the stock&#039;s dividend yield is 2.52%. Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 3.42%, the lowest has been 2.43%, and the highest has been 6.93%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.66 (n=236). The current dividend yield is 1.36 standard deviations below the historical average. Additionally, the company&#039;s dividend payout ratio is 0.60. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company&#039;s income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company&#039;s income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5. The company&#039;s 3-Year dividend growth rate is 0.42%, demonstrating that it has increased its dividend over time. Broadcom Background Information (This description is provided by the company.)
