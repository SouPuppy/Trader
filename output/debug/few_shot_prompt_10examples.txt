标题: What To Expect From Apple's Q3 Results?
内容: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to publish its Q3 FY’23 results in early August, reporting on another quarter that is likely to see Apple’s key computing products face sluggish demand. We expect earnings to stand at about $1.07 per share, slightly below consensus estimates. On the other hand, we expect revenues to come in about $74 billion, marking a decline of about 11% versus last year and marginally ahead of consensus estimates. So what are some of the trends that are likely to drive Apple’s results for the quarter? See our analysis on Apple Earnings Preview for a closer look at what to expect when Apple publishes earnings. While Q3 is typically a seasonally weak quarter for Apple, we expect sales of products such as the Mac and iPad to also decline year-over-year, as the remote working trend eases and the broader PC and tablet markets cool. For perspective, over Q2 FY’23, Apple’s Mac sales declined by about 31% year-over-year. However, sales of the iPhone could prove a bit more resilient, given the traction that Apple is seeing in markets such as India, Indonesia, and Turkey where installment plans and trade-in programs are helping drive demand. Apple’s digital services business should partly help Apple ride out the lull in its hardware business driven by higher sales at the AppStore and improving the uptake of other subscription services. However, growth rates are likely to remain below the levels seen last year. That said, it is likely that Apple will continue to expand its gross margins for the quarter driven by a higher mix of service sales, more premium products, and also due to some cost savings. While Apple stock could move higher if it beats earnings, we believe that the stock is overvalued at current levels of about $195 per share. Apple currently trades at over 35x forward earnings, which is high relative to historical levels. Moreover, Apple’s earnings are poised to contr...

标题: Amazon made earnings look better — can Apple continue the momentum?
内容: Wall Street analysts expected the first quarter to be bad, as investors continue to bite their nails over the prospect of a recession, but after a tidal wave of quarterly financial results from corporate America last week, led by online retail behemoth Amazon.com Inc., there are signs of a little less anguish. Throughout April, Wall Street analysts lowered their second-quarter profit expectations for the 500 companies that make up the S&amp;P 500 index SPX by a smaller margin than normal, FactSet Senior Earnings Analyst John Butters...

标题: Attention Apple Users! Your Watch Will Likely Get A Radical Software Overhaul
内容: Apple, Inc. AAPL Watch is likely to get one of the biggest software updates, since the launch of its original version in 2015.What Happened: With WatchOS 10, the next iteration of the Apple Watch operating system, the company plans to bring back widgets, which were part of the earliest versions of the watch but discontinued after just a few years, wrote Bloomberg columnist Mark Gurman on Sunday.Cupertino now wants widgets as a central part of the interface, Gurman wrote.The updated software will be unveiled at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June, the columnist added.Why Is The Widget Back? The new widgets system will be a combination of the old watchOS Glances system and the style of the widgets that were introduced in iOS 14 on the iPhone, Gurman wrote."The plan is to let users scroll through a series of different widgets — for activity tracking, weather, stock tickers, calendar appointments and more — rather than having them launch apps," the columnist explained. The new interface, according to Gurman, will be similar to the Siri watch face that was introduced in WatchOS 4 but will be available as an overlay for any watch face.Apple is also testing altering functions of some of the watch buttons...

标题: Apple rises as key iPhone manufacturing facility nears 90% capacity (AAPL)
内容: yalcinsonat1/iStock via Getty Images Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares rose in premarket trading on Tuesday as the company and its manufacturing partner are getting closer to operating at full production for its iPhone 14 product line. The manufacturing plant for Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision (OTCPK:HNHPF), in Zhengzhou, China, is now said to be operating at roughly 90% of its capacity levels and has roughly 200,000 workers. According to Bloomberg, the Zhengzhou plant is now at roughly normal staffing levels and has bounced back in rapid fashion. On December 29, it was reported that the Zhengzhou plant was operating at 70%, indicating that Foxconn has been able to boost employment at the plant, sometimes known as "iPhone city." Foxconn dealt with worker unrest last month as a result of COVID-19 restrictions placed on it by Chinese government officials and unpaid bonuses. Foxconn ended the "closed-loop" system that had been in place at its Zhengzhou plant and apologized for the unpaid bonuses. On Monday, Reuters reported that the plant hit 90% of its original target. Last month, J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee wrote that iPhone supply was "improving and inching slowly toward parity with demand." Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida during his trip to Japan in December and .

标题: Want to Invest in a Retail Stock? Ask This Question First.
内容: Retail is a tough business in any economic climate. A small number of retailers -- think Costco (NASDAQ: COST) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) -- manage to build up durable competitive advantages over the course of decades. Most retailers aren&#039;t so lucky. Right now, many retail stocks look surprisingly cheap based on trailing earnings. Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (NYSE: BBY) goes for around 13 times earnings, department store Macy&#039;s (NYSE: M) trades for less than 5 times earnings, and grocery chain Kroger (NYSE: KR) changes hands for roughly 14 times earnings. Those are not particularly optimistic valuation multiples. Valuation has its limits With persistently high inflation and rising interest rates pressuring consumer spending, retailers in general are likely in for a rough and unpredictable 2023. Even the strongest retailers are starting to face headwinds. Walmart (NYSE: WMT), for example, suffered a gross margin decline in the third quarter of 2022 and guided for a drop in adjusted earnings for the full fiscal year. Many retailers will see their margins contract this year as consumers pull back on spending. While Macy&#039;s stock may look extremely inexpensive, for example, it&#039;s probably not as cheap as it looks. Analysts are expecting a modest decline in earnings for the company in the upcoming fiscal year, but that could turn out to be far too optimistic. It&#039;s a similar story with Best Buy. Despite tumbling demand for PCs and smartphones, analysts still expect a small increase in Best Buy&#039;s earnings per share in the upcoming fiscal year. Color me skeptical. Deciding whether or not to invest in a retailer based on past earnings is problematic for two reasons. First, because the past is the past, and second, because the past few years have been pretty weird. An unprecedented shutdown of the economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic in ear...

标题: Amazon Says Its Deliveries Were the Fastest Ever in the Second Quarter
内容: Amazon (AMZN) reported Monday it made the fastest deliveries ever to its Prime members last quarter. Doug Herrington, CEO of Worldwide Amazon Stores, said in the 60 largest U.S. metro areas, more than half of Prime member packages arrived on the same day or the next day from when they ordered them. He added so far this year, 1.8 billion units were shipped to U.S. Prime members on the same day or next day, more than four times what was delivered at those speeds before the pandemic in 2019. Amazon has achieved quicker delivery times by dividing the country into smaller, easier-to-reach regions, using machine-learning technology to better predict buying trends, and growing its same-day delivery network, Herrington explained. By making those changes, Amazon also reduced costs, which in turn helped customers save money, he said. Shares of Amazon advanced 1.1% following the news and traded around their 2023 highs. YCharts

标题: Can Amazon Recover Amid Tech Stock Sell-off?
内容: Amazon.com Inc NASDAQ: AMZN has rallied over the past month, gaining 19.48%. However, it sits at a loss of 28.95% over the past year. Investors might therefore be wondering where the company will be headed in the future and if the rally in its share is set to continue. Get Amazon.com alerts: Much of that trajectory could come down to how its earnings are received when it publishes its result on Feb 2 next week. Let's look at what the future might have in store for the company. Is Amazon a buy ahead of earnings? Although attempting to time the market is generally unadvisable, the looming recession has been discussed extensively over the past six months, so a lower stock price for Amazon and its peer companies could be on the cards. Some warnings include overvaluation in stocks and commodities, a downward trend in the S&P 500 index, a worse-than-expected rebound of consumer spending in China, and China's real estate prices continuing to fall lower each month. These signs all point towards capitulation in the market being possible to be realized soon. Adding to the pessimism is that executives of Amazon itself may hold a bleak outlook for the future. Plans to let go over 18,000 employees were signed off by Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy this year. However, it's also important to frame these Amazon layoffs correctly. It might not signal that Amazon expects long-term weakness, but rather it could be more of a pivot toward reaching greater efficiency. The stock prices and payrolls of tech companies were severely bloated by COVID-19 stimulus money that would never last long-term. The unexpected turnaround of the virus that came quickly in January last year saw restrictions lift, and the money flowing into these stocks detoured in a different direction. How the layoffs could benefit Amazon Layoffs are needed when business conditions change and the company's experiments don't work as expected. Jas...
